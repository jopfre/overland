British nationals have had passports stolen or lost in Moscow airports. Take care when passing through airports, particularly in the baggage collection area and outside the arrivals hall.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-spiking\">Drink spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Drink spiking, leading to robbery, violence or abuse, can happen. Victims are often left unconscious outside. This can be life-threatening in winter. Buy your own drinks and always keep them in sight.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-crime\">Violent crime</h3>\n\n<p>Violent criminals do not usually target foreign visitors. However, in St Petersburg gangs have targeted tourists for street crime.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"avoiding-unregistered-taxis\">Avoiding unregistered taxis</h3>\n\n<p>British nationals travelling in unregistered taxis have been victims of crime. Taxis that look official can be unlicensed. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>use a local taxi app to call a registered taxi</li>\n  <li>ask your hotel to call a taxi or give you the number of a reputable company</li>\n  <li>agree the fare before getting into the taxi or check that the meter is working</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Do not flag down a taxi or share a taxi with strangers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dating-services-scams\">Dating services scams</h3>\n\n<p>Dating services scams have affected British nationals. Never send money to or buy items for anyone you have not met in person.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"money-transfer-scams\">Money transfer scams</h3>\n\n<p>Be wary of sending money through untraceable transfer services. British nationals have lost money when sending it to unknown recipients without checking they’re genuine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fake-police-checks\">Fake police checks</h3>\n\n<p>The police do not need a reason to stop, question or detain you. Criminals posing as police officers have harassed and robbed tourists. If you’re stopped, always insist on seeing identification.

There may not be warning signs in locations where photography is banned. You could be detained or arrested if you break the law.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-drones\">Using drones</h3>\n\n<p>Due to current military activities, it is illegal to use drones in some regions. Check restrictions with the local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>You must get permission from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.favt.ru/\">Russian aviation authority</a> (in Russian) before using any unmanned aircraft systems (drones) in Russian airspace. You must tell them the flight route at least 24 hours in advance and keep in regular contact with them before and during the flight. You will get a fine if you do not comply.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cybersecurity-laws\">Cybersecurity laws</h3>\n\n<p>There are increasing restrictions to limit access to content posted on the internet, including social media platforms. Meta (Facebook and Instagram), X and LinkedIn are blocked in Russia. Access to other websites can be unreliable.</p>\n\n<p>More information is available from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://rkn.gov.ru/\">Federal Service for Surveillance of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media</a> (in Russian).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"racial-discrimination\">Racial discrimination</h3>\n\n<p>Most visitors experience no problems, but racial discrimination can happen in some areas. If you’re of African, Asian or Caribbean descent, you may receive unwanted attention in public places. Take care, particularly when travelling late at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Homosexuality is not illegal in Russia but there are considerable legislative restrictions which target the LGBT+ community. In January 2024 a Russian Supreme Court judgement came into force banning the so-called ‘international LGBT movement’ and designating it as ‘extremist’. ‘LGBT propaganda’ legislation bans people from promoting ‘non-traditional sexual relations’. If charged, foreign citizens could face: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>fines </li>\n  <li>up to 15 days in jail</li>\n  <li>deportation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Attitudes towards the LGBT+ community and LGBT+ issues are less tolerant than in the UK and vary in different locations. Government officials have made derogatory comments to LGBT+ individuals. Same-sex couples showing affection in public may receive negative attention.</p>\n\n<p>There are no laws to protect LGBT+ people from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>\n\n<p>Recent laws targeting LGBT+ communities include:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in 2012, Moscow Pride was banned for 100 years  </li>\n  <li>in 2022, a ban on the ‘demonstration of LGBT information, promotion of non-traditional sexual relations and change of gender’ to children and adults through the internet, films, advertisement, audio visual services and books (the “gay propaganda” law)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In November 2023, the Russian Supreme Court banned the so-called ‘international LGBT movement’, designating it as ‘extremist’. The court provided no definition of ‘international LGBT movement’.</p>\n\n<p>Displaying ‘extremist’ symbols and being a member of and donating money to ‘extremist’ organisations are criminal offences. This decision came in to force in January 2024. It is unclear how the authorities will implement the ruling but there have been reports of persecution for displaying the rainbow flag, considered by the authorities as a ‘symbol of an extremist organisation’.</p>\n\n<p>Harassment, threats and acts of violence towards the LGBT+ community have increased.</p>\n\n<p>The North Caucasus republics are particularly intolerant of the LGBT+ community. There have been reports of the arrest, torture and killing of gay men in Chechnya, allegedly conducted by Chechen regional authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"surrogacy\">Surrogacy</h3>\n\n<p>Russia has banned surrogacy for all foreign nationals except those married to Russian citizens.

They can face harassment from authorities, including detention, particularly at places of worship.</p>\n\n<p>Some other minority religious groups, like Scientologists, also face discrimination.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re planning to drive in Russia, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a> and check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/russia/\">rules of the road in the RAC’s Russia guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll need to have both the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 version of the international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> and your UK driving licence with you in the car.

See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-russia#driving-in-russia\">Living in Russia</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Road safety in Russia is poor and road conditions are unpredictable. Take care when driving, take account of weather conditions and consider avoiding driving at night. Do not drive alone at night or sleep in your vehicle on the side of the road. Do not pick up hitchhikers.</p>\n\n<p>Traffic police often stop drivers for spot checks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bringing-vehicles-into-russia\">Bringing vehicles into Russia</h3>\n\n<p>If you plan to drive into Russia, you must declare your vehicle to the customs authority on entry. You can bring a vehicle into Russia without paying import taxes for up to one year.</p>\n\n<p>Green cards are no longer accepted as proof of car or road insurance.

Many railway services require passengers to show their passports on boarding.</p>\n\n<p>If you are travelling by overnight train, store valuables in the container under the bed or seat. Do not look after luggage for other travellers or let them store it in your compartment.</p>\n\n<p>Do not leave your sleeping compartment empty, as some compartments only have a simple lock on the sliding door. On some trains, there may be an extra security device attached to the fitted handle or lock. There may also be a steel switch at head-height on the door panel which, when pulled down, prevents the closed door from being opened.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Air space will close during drone attacks. This has led to frequent and unpredictable delays, diversions and cancellations to flights in and out of airports in European Russia.</p>\n\n<p>There are restrictions on domestic flights to a number of airports in southern Russia, with disruption to internal flights to and from Moscow and other cities.
