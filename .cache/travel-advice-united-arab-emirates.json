British nationals have been arrested and charged under this law, often in cases where they have come to the attention of the police for a related offence, such as disorderly or offensive behaviour. </p>\n\n<p>The legal age for purchasing and drinking alcohol is 21 in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and the Northern Emirates except Sharjah, where drinking and having alcohol in your possession is illegal.  </p>\n\n<p>If you are resident in Dubai and want to buy alcohol to drink at home, you must get a liquor licence. Liquor licences are no longer required for residents in the other Emirates.  </p>\n\n<p>Liquor licences are not required in Dubai to purchase and consume alcohol in licenced venues like hotel bars, restaurants, and pubs. However, a liquor licence is required for consuming alcohol in private places like homes or private parties. While this requirement might not be strictly enforced in private settings, it remains a legal requirement.   </p>\n\n<p>Outside licensed venues, you can only buy alcohol with a liquor licence from the 2 official liquor distributors in Dubai, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://retail.mmidubai.com/\">MMI</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.africaneastern.com/\">African &amp; Eastern</a>.

You can buy and drink alcohol in licensed venues, such as hotels, restaurants and clubs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-penalties\">Illegal drugs penalties  </h3>\n\n<p>There is zero tolerance for drugs-related offences.   </p>\n\n<p>The penalties for trafficking, smuggling, using and possessing illegal drugs (including residual amounts) are severe. Sentences for drug trafficking can include the death penalty. Possession of even the smallest amount of illegal drugs can lead to a minimum 3-month prison term or a fine of between 20,000 <abbr title=\"United Arab Emirates\">UAE</abbr> dirham and 100,000 <abbr title=\"United Arab Emirates\">UAE</abbr> dirham. The Emirati authorities count the presence of drugs in the blood stream as possession.   </p>\n\n<p>Some ‘herbal highs’ and products containing cannabidiol  (CBD) are illegal in the <abbr title=\"United Arab Emirates\">UAE</abbr>.   </p>\n\n<p>Possessing, concealing or making transactions with money from drugs-related offences is illegal. You could get a prison sentence and a fine.  </p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"United Arab Emirates\">UAE</abbr> airports have excellent technology and security for detecting illegal items.

You can be arrested for carrying drugs, even residual amounts.</p>\n\n<p>Some skincare products and e-cigarette refills may contain ingredients that are illegal in the <abbr title=\"United Arab Emirates\">UAE</abbr> such as CBD oil. If you are found in possession of such products, they will be confiscated and you could face criminal charges.

Check for warning signs, especially red flags which mean that swimming is dangerous. Only swim from approved beaches where there are lifeguards and flags indicating it is safe to swim .  </p>\n\n<p>See <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rlss.org.uk/safety-on-holiday\">water safety on holiday</a> from the Royal Life Saving Society.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks  </h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis </h3>\n\n<p>Use only licensed taxis or other recognised forms of public transport, which includes apps like ‘Careem’, ‘Uber’ and Abu Dhabi Taxi. In Dubai authorised taxis are painted cream with different coloured roofs – taxis with pink roofs have female drivers. In Abu Dhabi taxis are painted silver/grey.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel  </h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in the <abbr title=\"United Arab Emirates\">UAE</abbr>, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a> and check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/justice-safety-and-the-law/road-safety\"><abbr title=\"United Arab Emirates\">UAE</abbr> traffic portal</a>.   </p>\n\n<p>You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in the <abbr title=\"United Arab Emirates\">UAE</abbr>. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence\">update it to a photocard licence</a> or get the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">correct version of the international driving permit (IDP)</a> as well. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re applying for residence in the <abbr title=\"United Arab Emirates\">UAE</abbr>, you can use your UK licence until your residence permit is issued, after which you’ll need to get a <abbr title=\"United Arab Emirates\">UAE</abbr> driving licence from the traffic department.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-standards\">Driving standards</h3>\n\n<p>Driving standards are not always as disciplined as in the UK and there is a high rate of traffic accidents. Speeding is common, despite clearly signposted legal limits and widespread use of speed cameras.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rules-of-the-road\">Rules of the road</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to drink and drive, no matter how small the amount, and your insurance is likely to be invalidated in the event of an accident.</p>\n\n<p>Police in the <abbr title=\"United Arab Emirates\">UAE</abbr> have the power to impound your car for traffic violations that may be considered minor in the UK. They will charge a fee of 50,000 <abbr title=\"United Arab Emirates\">UAE</abbr> dirham plus a traffic violation fine to release your car.    </p>\n\n<p>Offensive gestures and bad language directed at other drivers can lead to fines, a jail sentence, and possibly deportation.   </p>\n\n<p>Flashing headlights can mean a driver is coming through, rather than giving way to you.  </p>\n\n<p>If you have an accident, follow the rules of the emirate in which you are travelling:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in Abu Dhabi, if no one has been hurt and vehicle damage is minor, move your vehicle to the side of the road to avoid blocking traffic, otherwise do not move your vehicle</li>\n  <li>in Dubai, only move your vehicle if it is causing an obstruction to other motorists</li>\n  <li>in the other emirates, only move your car if the accident is minor and both parties agree who is responsible</li>\n  <li>in all cases, call the police – it is illegal to leave the scene of an accident before the police have arrived</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-in-the-desert\">Driving in the desert </h3>\n\n<p>Excursions to the desert can be dangerous unless you’re in a properly equipped 4-wheel-drive vehicle. Always travel with other cars, take a supply of water and a mobile telephone. Leave a copy of your travel plans with relatives, friends or where you are staying.   </p>\n\n<p>If you join a tour for driving in the desert or quad-biking, make sure you go with a reputable company with adequate health and safety procedures.   </p>\n\n<p>Always check that such activities are covered by your insurance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel </h3>\n\n<p>Be careful when travelling by tourist boat. The safety of these vessels may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available for all passengers.  </p>\n\n<p>Many areas of the Gulf are highly sensitive, including near maritime boundaries and the islands of Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the southern Gulf. The authorities have detained and inspected vessels entering these areas. Mariners should make careful enquiries with relevant local authorities before entering these waters.  </p>\n\n<p>You should consider how regional tensions may affect your route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of maritime attack.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>Heavy rain in the <abbr title=\"United Arab Emirates\">UAE</abbr> can cause flooding.
