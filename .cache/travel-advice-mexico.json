To work or volunteer, you must get the correct visa from the Mexican Embassy before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>You may need a visa for some adventure or ecotourism activities like caving, potholing or entomology, especially if they involve any scientific or technological research. The Mexican authorities may define scientific or technological research activities far more broadly than other countries. If in doubt, ask the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/reinounido/index.php/en/\">Mexican Embassy in UK</a> well before you travel and ask for written confirmation if necessary.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"airport-e-gates-for-tourists\">Airport e-gates for tourists</h3>\n\n<p>If you are a tourist aged 18 or over, you can use e-gates in some of the main international airports in Mexico. You must show the printed e-gate ticket when you leave the country, so be sure to collect it.</p>\n\n<p>You can download digital proof of entry and how long you are allowed to stay in Mexico from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.inm.gob.mx/spublic/portal/inmex.html\">Portal de Servicios del INM</a> (in Spanish) within the first 60 days of your visit.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"checks-at-border-control\">Checks at border control</h2>\n\n<p>At Mexican border control, you may need to: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>show a return or onward ticket</li>\n  <li>show proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel booking confirmation</li>\n  <li>prove that you have enough money for your stay</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you’re staying in someone’s home, immigration officials may also ask for a ‘letter of invitation’ from the person you’re visiting. This should include as much information as possible, including the host and travellers’:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>full names</li>\n  <li>contact details</li>\n  <li>address while in Mexico</li>\n  <li>reason for visit</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Warning\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit.  </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>If you’re entering Mexico from the USA, and there is no immigration officer to stamp your passport, find the nearest immigration office before continuing. Immigration offices are usually near the border, and customs officials should be able to direct you. It is often more complicated to correct immigration issues once you leave the border area.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travelling-with-children\">Travelling with children</h2>\n\n<p>If you are travelling with a child, you may be asked for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>evidence of your relationship with them – for example, a birth or adoption certificate, divorce or marriage certificates, or a parental responsibility order</li>\n  <li>the reason you are travelling with them</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"children-with-dual-nationality\">Children with dual nationality</h3>\n\n<p>Children with dual nationality of Mexico who are travelling without a parent or legal guardian must apply for a permit to leave the country.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccine-requirements\">Vaccine requirements</h2>\n\n<p>For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/147/mexico#Vaccine_Recommendations\">TravelHealthPro’s Mexico guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://consulmex.sre.gob.mx/reinounido/index.php/es/contenido/79-customs-and-migration-information\">goods you can bring into and take out of Mexico</a>. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.</p>\n\n<p>Check whether you will need to declare anything to customs officials. If you have goods to declare, you must <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://siat.sat.gob.mx/app/declaracion/faces/pages/plantilla/declaracionAduana.jsf\">submit a customs form online</a> before travelling to Mexico. If you do not declare goods, customs officials may seize them and you could get a fine.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"entry-tax-for-the-state-of-quintana-roo\">Entry tax for the state of Quintana Roo</h2>\n\n<p>You must pay an entry tax to visit the state of Quintana Roo – you can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.visitax.gob.mx/sitio/\">pay the entry tax online</a> before or during your stay. You can get help paying online at Cancun Airport. You must show proof of payment at the airport before leaving.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"leaving-mexico\">Leaving Mexico</h2>\n\n<p>To leave Mexico, you must show your passport with the entry stamp showing how many days you were allowed to stay.</p>\n\n<p>If you lose your passport, you must pay a fee to replace the entry stamp. The fee is about 700 Mexican pesos, to be paid at the immigration office by card or in a bank with cash. Migration officers do not accept cash. You can replace the stamp at the immigration office at any international airport in Mexico or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.inm.gob.mx/mpublic/publico/inm-tramites.html?a=thgeGuQHx2k%3D&amp;tr=OxdxfZW6EOE%3D&amp;h_sdp00=giUnJ9XgtISVcdYJXduIGw%3D%3D\">start the entry stamp replacement process online</a>. Updated fees should be displayed at the immigration offices.  </p>\n\n<p>Fake immigration officers can operate in international airports. Always refuse offers of help and head directly to the immigration office.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"departure-tax\">Departure tax</h3>\n\n<p>You may need to pay a departure tax when leaving Mexico by air or land. The cost can vary, and some airports or border crossings only accept cash. Most airlines include the cost within the ticket price. If in doubt, check with your airline or tour operator.</p>\n","slug":"entry-requirements","title":"Entry requirements"},{"body":"<p>This guide also has safety advice for <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/mexico/regional-risks\">regions of Mexico</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"terrorism\">Terrorism</h2>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.  </p>\n\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack.

Demonstrations can be tense, confrontational and potentially violent. Onlookers can be quickly drawn in.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal for foreign nationals to participate in political activities in Mexico. If you join demonstrations, the Mexican authorities may detain and deport you.</p>\n\n<p>Monitor local media and avoid all demonstrations. If you come across protests, move away from the area.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Crime is a risk to foreign nationals in Mexico, particularly in major cities and tourist resort areas. Street crime is a serious issue in these places.</p>\n\n<p>Many Mexican and foreign businesses choose to hire private security. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>research your destination thoroughly</li>\n  <li>only travel during daylight hours when possible</li>\n  <li>monitor local media</li>\n  <li>tell trusted contacts your travel plans</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you want to report a crime, do so immediately at the nearest branch of the state prosecutor’s office (‘Agencia del Ministerio Público’). A criminal investigation is not possible without a formal complaint to the Mexican authorities. You must make a complaint in person before you leave Mexico.</p>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.c5.cdmx.gob.mx/dependencia/acerca-de/el-c5-de-la-cdmx\">Mexico City Command and Control Centre</a> (‘Centro de Atención a Emergencias y Protección Ciudadana de la Ciudad de México’) has information and advice on safety in Mexico City in Spanish.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-atms\">Using ATMs</h3>\n\n<p>Take care withdrawing money from ATMs or using exchange offices (bureau de change). Criminals have targeted people using these services. It’s generally safer to use ATMs during daylight hours inside shops or malls. Avoid withdrawing large amounts and watch who is around you while you are at an ATM.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Pickpocketing and theft are common, including on public transport. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid wearing expensive-looking clothing, jewellery or watches</li>\n  <li>limit the amount of cash or credit and debit cards you carry</li>\n  <li>watch your luggage, even in apparently secure places like the lobby of your hotel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Be wary of criminals posing as police officers and trying to fine or arrest you for no reason. They have targeted travellers driving rental cars.</p>\n\n<p>Some genuine police officers have extorted money from tourists for alleged minor offences or traffic violations. If this happens:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>do not hand over money or your passport</li>\n  <li>ask for a copy of the fine, which is payable later</li>\n  <li>ask for ID</li>\n  <li>try to note the officer’s name, badge number and patrol car number</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Criminals may try to get your friends or relatives to transfer money to Mexico. This can happen if your phone is stolen or hacked. Before you travel, agree how you will contact friends or relatives and how you would arrange to transfer money.</p>\n\n<p>A common phone scam involves criminals posing as a kidnapped family member or employee and demanding money for their release. They may also claim a relative is being detained. If you are threatened over the phone, hang up and check on your family member or employee’s safety.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking\">Drink and food spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Do not leave food and drinks unattended in bars and restaurants. Criminals have robbed or assaulted travellers after drugging them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tainted-alcohol\">Tainted alcohol</h3>\n\n<p>Tainted alcohol has caused illness or blackouts. If you have any concerns, get advice from your tour operator or the local authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Sexual offences have been reported in tourist areas. Take care even in areas close to hotels, and especially after dark.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"kidnapping\">Kidnapping</h3>\n\n<p>Kidnapping is more common in some areas of Mexico than others. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/mexico/regional-risks\">Regional risks</a> for areas of higher risk. While tourists are not usually targeted, you should always remain aware of your surroundings.</p>\n\n<p>Short-term opportunistic kidnapping (called ‘express kidnapping’) can happen, particularly in urban areas. Kidnappers force victims to withdraw money at an ATM to secure their release.</p>\n\n<p>Longer-term kidnapping for financial gain also happens, and there have been allegations of police involvement. You should always remain alert and avoid travelling in higher risk areas, especially at night. Be discreet about discussing your financial or business affairs in places where others may overhear you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violence\">Violence</h3>\n\n<p>Drug-related violence in Mexico has increased over recent years. Do not become involved with drugs of any kind.      </p>\n\n<p>Some areas of Mexico have a high crime rate due to fighting between rival organised crime gangs. In these areas, there is a risk of being caught in the crossfire or of being mistaken for a gang member. While risks are lower in tourist areas, you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>take advice from local authorities or your hotel</li>\n  <li>be aware of your surroundings at all times</li>\n  <li>use reputable tourism or transport companies</li>\n  <li>travel during the daytime where possible</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-crime\">Vehicle crime</h3>\n\n<p>Stay away from isolated roads and use toll roads (‘cuotas’) whenever possible. Keep car doors locked and windows closed, especially at traffic lights.</p>\n\n<p>Violent carjackings and robberies happen along the Pacific Highway. If you suspect someone is following or watching you, drive to a police station or another safe place. Criminals have targeted large camper vans and sports utility vehicles (SUVs).</p>\n\n<p>Criminals can deliberately cause traffic accidents to make insurance claims or get cash from the other party. They sometimes threaten violence or intimidation. Contact the authorities for support if necessary.</p>\n\n<p>If you are involved in a carjacking, stay calm and surrender your valuables and your vehicle if asked. Resisting demands for your belongings can put you at significant risk of harm.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"roadblocks\">Roadblocks</h3>\n\n<p>In remote areas, you may come across unofficial roadblocks, including on main roads. Local groups seeking money for an unofficial toll control these roadblocks. They can become violent and deny entry.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"unlicensed-taxis\">Unlicensed taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Unlicensed taxi drivers have robbed and assaulted passengers, including in Mexico City. Use the better regulated ‘sitio’ taxis from authorised taxi ranks or ask your hotel to order you a taxi. At airports, only use authorised pre-paid airport taxi services.</p>\n\n<p>Licensed taxi drivers protesting about Uber have blocked roads near Cancun’s hotels. The protesters have pulled tourists from Uber taxis. Tourists have also missed flights due to roadblocks. Protests can happen without notice. Look for local announcements and follow your hotel’s advice on how to avoid protests.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-transport\">Public transport</h3>\n\n<p>Be alert on public transport, at airports and in bus stations. Theft on buses is common, so keep your belongings safe.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of bus hijacking. Try to travel on first-class buses using toll roads, which have a lower rate of incidents than second and third-class buses travelling on the less secure free (‘libre’) roads. Most first-class bus companies perform security checks when passengers board the bus.</p>\n\n<p>Women travelling alone on public transport have been harassed, robbed and sexually assaulted.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cancun-and-other-tourist-destinations\">Cancun and other tourist destinations</h3>\n\n<p>The Mexican government makes efforts to protect major tourist destinations, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Cancun</li>\n  <li>Tulum</li>\n  <li>Cozumel</li>\n  <li>Los Cabos</li>\n  <li>Nuevo Vallarta</li>\n  <li>Playa del Carmen</li>\n  <li>Puerto Vallarta</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Criminals have physically and sexually assaulted British travellers in these locations. In some cases, hotel employees, taxi drivers and security personnel were involved. Hotel staff have sometimes been unhelpful and tried to convince victims not to contact police.</p>\n\n<p>Rival criminal gangs have clashed in popular Cancun tourist destinations and surrounding areas. Gangs have not targeted tourists, but violent incidents could affect anyone nearby. Since 2021, several shootings have affected tourists.</p>\n\n<p>Be very cautious after dark in downtown areas of Cancun, Tulum and Playa del Carmen. Stay in well-lit pedestrian streets and tourist zones. Follow advice from the local authorities and your tour operator.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>For information on procedures, local laws or social services, you can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mexicocity.cdmx.gob.mx/e/about/about-locatel/\">contact Mexico City’s public telephone service LOCATEL</a> on 5658 1111 (English-speaking staff available).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>The Mexican authorities can ask to see your passport and entry stamp to prove your entrance and stay.

If you cannot show the correct documents, immigration officers may question and detain you while they check your immigration status. Depending on the outcome, they can deport you.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a resident, the police may ask to see your Mexican residency card. They have detained British people for not having the correct documents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking-and-e-cigarette-bans\">Smoking and e-cigarette bans</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to bring e-cigarettes, vaping devices and solutions into Mexico or to buy and sell them. Customs officials will confiscate these items; and they could fine or detain you.</p>\n\n<p>If you smoke or vape in a public place, you can get a fine of up to 3,000 Mexican pesos (about £150).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Do not become involved with drugs of any kind. Penalties for drug offences are severe and convictions carry sentences of up to 25 years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relations in Mexico are generally tolerated, rather than accepted.

British nationals participating in these activities have been injured and, in some cases, killed. Check your travel insurance covers you for all your planned activities.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure the company you use:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>is reputable</li>\n  <li>takes safety precautions</li>\n  <li>uses up-to-date equipment</li>\n  <li>is fully licensed and insured</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-safety\">Swimming safety</h3>\n\n<p>Sea conditions can be unpredictable, and some beaches are unpatrolled. Follow coastguard and local authority guidance on whether it is safe to swim.</p>\n\n<p>See <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rlss.org.uk/safety-on-holiday\">water safety on holiday</a> from the Royal Life Saving Society. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sharks-and-crocodiles\">Sharks and crocodiles</h3>\n\n<p>Shark attacks are rare in Mexico, but you should take care, particularly when surfing. Research the area and follow local advice.</p>\n\n<p>Crocodiles normally live in lagoons and coastal areas in Mexico, including Cancun and Pacific coast resorts. Respect warning signs around lagoons in these areas and do not walk close to the water. Crocodiles have attacked and seriously injured tourists in the past.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Mexico, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Mexico. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence\">update it to a photocard licence</a> or get the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1926 version of the international driving permit (IDP)</a> as well.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-standards\">Driving standards</h3>\n\n<p>Driving standards are very different from the UK. Roads can have potholes, and conditions can be unpredictable. Be prepared to stop unexpectedly and beware of vehicles moving slowly, changing lane without indicating and going through red lights. Many drivers do not have car insurance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-restrictions\">Driving restrictions</h3>\n\n<p>To reduce pollution, the authorities ban cars entering parts of Mexico City and other places on some days of the week, based on their number plates. For details, check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://sedema.cdmx.gob.mx/programas/programa/hoy-no-circula\">Hoy no Circula programme</a> (in Spanish).</p>\n\n<p>The authorities strictly enforce these regulations. Offenders face heavy fines and temporary confiscation of their vehicle. Check with your car hire company to see if these rules apply to you.</p>\n\n<p>In Mexico City, vehicles without registration plates from the State of Mexico (‘Estado de Mexico’) or Mexico City are not allowed to enter Mexico City from:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Monday to Friday, 5am to 11am</li>\n  <li>Saturday, 5am to 10pm</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There may be further driving restrictions if air pollution is high, generally from February to June.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hurricanes\">Hurricanes</h3>\n\n<p>The hurricane season in Mexico normally runs from June to November and can affect the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. Tropical storms and hurricanes cause floods, landslides and disruption to local services, including transport networks. After a hurricane there can still be continued flooding, high winds and rainfall.</p>\n\n<p>Monitor local and international weather updates from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\">US National Hurricane Center</a> and follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator, including evacuation orders.</p>\n\n<p>In 2023, Hurricane Otis hit the south coast near Acapulco. This Category 5 hurricane seriously damaged infrastructure along the coast, in Acapulco and between Zihuatenejo and Punta Maldonado.

Tijuana is an extremely violent city. Criminals could target you or you could get caught up in conflicts between rival groups.</p>\n\n<p>Many businesses, including shops, follow an unofficial curfew, only opening during daylight hours due to the security threat. Organised crime groups are fighting for control over the city’s drug trade and trafficking routes. There are high rates of kidnapping, murder and organised crime activity, particularly drug, human and arms trafficking.</p>\n\n<p>Armed attacks and targeted killings happen across the state. Violent robberies are a particular issue in the urban centres of Tijuana, Mexicali and Ensenada. Be careful in Tijuana, Mexicali, Ensenada and Rosarito – armed criminals in these towns have targeted stores and bystanders in response to disputes with the government. There have also been incidents of vehicles being targeted by armed attacks.

There are reports of an increase in crime, robbery and looting across the city, including in previously designated tourist areas. Take extreme care if you travel to Acapulco.</p>\n\n<p>Local crime groups control toll booths at illegal roadblocks. If you come across these, you will need cash to pay the fee so you can continue. If you’re driving in Guerrero, avoid travel after dark and use toll roads where possible, although you may still experience disruptions.</p>\n\n<p>The interior of the state is dangerous. Organised crime groups and local ‘self-defence’ groups often exert control over territory. These groups are likely to be suspicious of foreign nationals in rural Guerrero. There is a high possibility of a misunderstanding resulting in violence. There has been armed crime in and outside tourist areas in the state.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"centre\">Centre</h3>\n\n<p>Criminal activity is a problem in the state of Mexico (‘Estado de México’). Take care when travelling through the state, as well as outside of tourist areas. There has been:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>armed robbery on public transport</li>\n  <li>vehicle theft on the highway</li>\n  <li>petty crime</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"south\">South</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"chiapas\">Chiapas</h3>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all but essential travel to within 40km of the Guatemalan border between the Pacific Coast up to and including the border crossing at Gracias a Dio.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all but essential travel on Federal Highway 199 (Carretera Federal 199) between Rancho Nuevo (just outside San Cristobal de las Casas) and the Chancalá junction just outside Palenque (where Federal Highway 199 meets Federal Highway 307).</p>\n\n<p>The border between Chiapas and Guatemala is dangerous due to the presence of many organised crime groups who fight for control of drug- and human-trafficking routes. Gangs do not usually target tourists, but you could be a victim of violence due to mistaken identity or on suspicion of spying for other organised criminal gangs. There is a risk of being caught in crossfire between rival organised crime groups.</p>\n\n<p>Illegal roadblocks and checkpoints are reported frequently on Federal Highway 199 (Carretera Federal 199) between Rancho Nuevo, just outside San Cristobal de las Casas, and Palenque. Protests by indigenous groups often block the road. There is a risk of kidnapping.</p>\n\n","slug":"regional-risks","title":"Regional risks"},{"body":"<p>Before you travel check that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>your destination can provide the healthcare you may need</li>\n  <li>you have <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">appropriate travel insurance</a> for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"emergency-medical-number\">Emergency medical number</h2>\n\n<p>Dial 911 and ask for an ambulance.</p>\n\n<p>In Mexico City, you can use emergency buttons on CCTV cameras across the city to immediately connect to the emergency services.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of state capitals and larger urban areas, medical and emergency services may be limited.
