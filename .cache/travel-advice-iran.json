You must be able to produce your British passport or a valid UK visa in your Iranian passport on request. You cannot apply for a British passport from Iran.  </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"risk-of-arrest-detention-and-a-death-sentence\">Risk of arrest, detention and a death sentence  </h2>\n\n<p>There is a very high risk of arrest, questioning and detention for British nationals and British-Iranian dual nationals. If the Iranian authorities accuse you of security related offences as a British national in Iran, there is a risk that you will be sentenced to death. </p>\n\n<p>Holding a British passport or having perceived connections to the UK can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you. If you are detained in Iran, you could face months or years of imprisonment.   </p>\n\n<p>British nationals, including British-Iranian dual nationals, and other foreign nationals, have been unfairly detained in Iran. They are often made to serve long prison sentences. In 2023, Iran executed some foreign national detainees, including a British-Iranian national. The criminal justice process in these cases falls below international standards. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"consular-welfare-and-family-access-while-in-detention\">Consular, welfare and family access while in detention   </h3>\n\n<p>If you are detained in Iran, your case will be in the hands of the Iranian authorities, who have demonstrated a pattern of hostility towards the UK and its citizens. If you are a British-Iranian dual national, the UK government will not be notified of your detention, nor will we be given permission to see you. The Iranian authorities will control your access to your family during your detention. If you die in Iranian detention, the Iranian authorities will control the notification process. There is no guarantee the Iranian authorities will inform family members or the UK government.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protests\">Protests </h3>\n\n<p>Iranian authorities have accused people with links to the UK of inciting protests. If you are in or near a protest, you are at serious risk of arrest. Mass arrests, including of bystanders, happen often. It is difficult to predict where protests will take place, and they may turn violent. British nationals arrested in connection with protests may come under increased suspicion of espionage or working to undermine the Iranian authorities. This can increase the risk of lengthy detention, criminal charges or receiving the death penalty.   </p>\n\n<p>You may also come under suspicion if you are near sensitive sites, have contact with Iranians who are of interest to the authorities for any reason, or are taking photographs. The Iranian authorities have arrested foreign nationals for possessing photographic equipment near sensitive sites.  </p>\n\n<p>Even if you avoid protests and crowds, there is still a very high risk of arrest, questioning and detention in Iran.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"activities-that-put-you-at-risk\">Activities that put you at risk </h3>\n\n<p>Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for the authorities to detain you. Some activities put you at even greater risk.  </p>\n\n<p>You are at greater risk if you have ever been involved with civil society organisations, including:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>charities </li>\n  <li>labour unions </li>\n  <li>human rights groups </li>\n  <li>environmental groups </li>\n  <li>political groups </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or are involved in other activities such as: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>journalism, including blogging </li>\n  <li>social media related to politics, journalism or Iran, including creating, ‘liking’, or sharing content </li>\n  <li>economic and academic institutions and think tanks, especially UK-affiliated institutions or institutions conducting research in/on Iran </li>\n  <li>protest movements, including the ‘Woman, Life, Freedom’ movement </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or are involved with any person or organisation that:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>is seen as opposing the Iran government, either based within Iran or elsewhere </li>\n  <li>works on UK national infrastructure </li>\n  <li>receives public funds from, or is considered linked to, the UK government or law enforcement </li>\n  <li>was previously arrested, questioned or detained in Iran </li>\n  <li>is seen as having defected from the Iranian regime </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Having a British passport or connections to the UK will put you at increased risk of scrutiny during times of national unrest, following any terrorist incidents, or when there is an increase in tensions between Iran and the international community. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"border-areas\">Border areas  </h2>\n\n<p>Border areas are highly sensitive. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office \">FCDO</abbr> advises all British nationals already residing in Iran against all travel:   </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>within 100km of the Iran-Afghanistan border   </li>\n  <li>within 10km of the entire Iran-Iraq border   </li>\n  <li>to the provinces of Sistan and Baluchistan   </li>\n  <li>to the area east of Bam and Jask, including Bam  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is risk of banditry in the area east of Bam, Jask, and Sistan and Baluchistan. This is the main route for drug traffickers from Afghanistan and Pakistan. The towns of Zahedan, Zabol and Mirjaveh are particularly insecure.  </p>\n\n<p>Some Iranian officials and media reports have falsely alleged a UK connection to anti-government groups in Khuzestan, Kurdish-majority regions, and Sistan and Baluchistan. If you travel to these areas against our advice, stick to the main routes to avoid accidentally entering restricted or military zones. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime </h2>\n\n<p>Take sensible precautions to protect yourself from street crime and petty theft. Avoid carrying large amounts of money and keep your passport safe.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams  </h3>\n\n<p>There have been some attacks and robberies targeted at foreign nationals and tourists, including attempted robberies by thieves posing as policemen, usually in civilian clothing. If you’re approached by anyone who claims to be a policeman, ask to see ID and request the presence of a uniformed officer or marked patrol car. Do not hand over documents or cash, or get into a vehicle.  </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"money\">Money  </h2>\n\n<p>Getting cash in Iran is extremely difficult. Non-Iranian debit and cash cards will not work in Iran. It’s usually not possible to change travellers cheques.  </p>\n\n<p>It’s illegal to change money on the street. You can exchange selected foreign currencies in some exchange offices, though you may have problems changing money. Euros and US dollars are more commonly accepted than British pounds. </p>\n\n<p>Find out before travelling how you will get enough Iranian rials for your visit legally. If you cannot, you may need to reconsider your travel plans. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"surrogacy-and-adoption\">Surrogacy and adoption  </h2>\n\n<p>If you’re visiting Iran to arrange an international surrogacy or adoption, consider the risks and challenges involved. Surrogacy is a complex, lengthy process. You should: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>make sure you’re aware of the facts and well prepared before starting the process  </li>\n  <li>get specialist legal advice on Iranian and UK laws before making any arrangements  </li>\n  <li>read <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office \">FCDO</abbr> and Home Office <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surrogacy-overseas\">guidance on surrogacy overseas</a>   </li>\n  <li>research clinics and hospitals thoroughly to make sure they are safe and reputable  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The British Embassy cannot get involved in surrogacy arrangements or recommend hospitals or clinics.  </p>\n\n<p>Commissioning a surrogacy will not automatically mean that the child holds British citizenship. To bring your child born through surrogacy from Iran to the UK, you must <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports\">apply for a full British passport</a>. You need an Iranian birth certificate for this. It’s not possible to apply for a British passport from Iran. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences  </h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan </h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. During this time, do not eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in your car. </p>\n\n<p>You should also:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants   </li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens   </li>\n  <li>be aware that fasting can cause tiredness, particularly during the later afternoon and early evening  </li>\n  <li>be patient and show tolerance  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.   </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-codes\">Dress codes  </h3>\n\n<p>Islamic codes of behaviour and dress are strictly enforced. In public places women must cover their heads with a headscarf, wear trousers or a floor-length skirt, and a long-sleeved tunic or coat that reaches to mid-thigh or knee. Men should wear long trousers and long-sleeved shirts in public. </p>\n\n<p>There are extra dress requirements at religious sites. Women may be asked to put on a chador (a garment that covers the whole body except the face) before entering. </p>\n\n<p>The Iranian authorities have arrested, detained and in some cases committed serious acts of violence against women and girls for not properly following dress codes. Enforcement ‘crackdowns’ can lead to large-scale arrests across the country at any time. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"relationships-between-men-and-women\">Relationships between men and women  </h3>\n\n<p>Adultery and sex outside marriage are illegal under Iranian law and carry the death penalty.  </p>\n\n<p>Relationships between non-Muslim men and Muslim women are illegal, although few westerners have been prosecuted. If a Muslim woman is found in a relationship with a non-Muslim man, she may be sentenced to be whipped.  </p>\n\n<p>Unmarried partners and friends of the opposite sex travelling together should be extremely cautious. Sex outside marriage and same-sex relations are against the law in Iran, with the death penalty as the defined punishment.  </p>\n\n<p>Iranian hotel managers could insist on seeing a marriage certificate before allowing couples to share a hotel room.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-relationships\">LGBT+ relationships  </h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships are illegal under Iranian law and can carry the death penalty.   </p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"female-travellers\">Female travellers  </h3>\n\n<p>Women should take extra care, particularly when travelling alone or with friends of the opposite sex. Women face a range of issues, from enforced hijab wearing to harassment due to there being relatively few foreign women in Iran. Respect local customs and avoid isolated areas. See more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">advice for women travelling abroad</a>.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"streaming-service-bans\">Streaming service bans </h3>\n\n<p>Many western streaming services including Netflix and Prime are banned in Iran.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-ban\">Alcohol ban </h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to import, sell, manufacture or drink alcohol in Iran. This is on religious grounds, with exceptions only for certain recognised Iranian religious minorities. Drinking alcohol in public is not allowed, with no exceptions. Penalties can be severe. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-electronic-devices\">Using cameras and electronic devices  </h3>\n\n<p>Photography near military and other government installations is strictly prohibited. You can be detained and charged with breaking national security laws. Sensitive government buildings and facilities are often difficult to identify. Take extreme care when taking photographs in any area. The Iranian authorities have arrested foreign nationals for possessing photographic equipment near sensitive sites. </p>\n\n<p>Using a laptop or other electronic equipment in public places can be misinterpreted, especially if your device contains photographs. You may be arrested and detained on serious criminal charges, including espionage.  </p>\n\n<p>It’s better to ask before taking photographs of people.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-penalties\">Illegal drugs penalties </h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to import, sell, manufacture or consume drugs in Iran. Penalties for importing and possessing drugs are severe and enforced. Many people convicted of drug offences, including foreign nationals, have been executed.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID  </h3>\n\n<p>You must carry copies of your passport photo page and visa for identification. Make sure you have a copy of the emergency contact details. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"satellite-phones-and-drones\">Satellite phones and drones  </h3>\n\n<p>You need permission from the Iranian authorities to import or use equipment like drones or satellite phones. Using them without permission is illegal and you could be arrested. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mobile-phones-internet-access-and-communications\">Mobile phones, internet access and communications  </h3>\n\n<p>Iranian authorities have blocked, significantly slowed or shut down landline, internet and mobile services without warning in the past. This can be nationwide or localised. This can affect communication and location services on smartphones and other devices. You should:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>not rely on mobile data, non-Iranian mobile apps or international calls for personal safety  </li>\n  <li>always keep an alternative means of communication and navigation with you </li>\n  <li>make sure friends and family know where you are  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"business-travellers\">Business travellers  </h3>\n\n<p>Individuals involved in commercial disputes with Iranian companies risk being stopped from leaving the country until disputes are resolved.  </p>\n\n<p>Representatives of British or western companies may receive particular attention. British businesspeople travelling to Iran against our advice should take steps to protect commercially sensitive information, including password protection of electronic devices and not carrying unnecessary information. Electronic devices may be screened by customs officials on arrival and departure. </p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-business-risk-iran\">Overseas business risk in Iran</a> for more information. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks </h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel  </h3>\n\n<p>If you’re planning to drive in Iran, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>. </p>\n\n<p>You must have a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 international driving permit (<abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> when using a UK driving licence to drive in Iran. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. </p>\n\n<p>Iran has a high rate of road accidents. Take great care when travelling by car or public transport and when crossing streets. If you’re involved in an accident, no matter how minor, do not leave the scene. Wait until the police arrive to write their report.  </p>\n\n<p>Iranian authorities sometimes set up informal roadblocks both in cities and on main highways. These are often staffed by young and inexperienced officers. Always carry identification with you and avoid getting into disputes.  </p>\n\n<p>It is not widely accepted for women to drive motorbikes on public roads and there is a risk of being arrested.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis  </h3>\n\n<p>Motorcycle taxis should not be used as they have sometimes taken tourists to quiet locations and robbed them.  </p>\n\n<p>Pre-booked taxis are safer than taxis hailed from the street.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel  </h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> (ASL) lists all known airlines in Iran that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel  </h3>\n\n<p>Many areas of the Caspian Sea, Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman are very politically and militarily sensitive, with increased military activity including seizures and attempted seizures, boardings and harassment of maritime vessels. </p>\n\n<p>The waters around the islands of Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the southern Persian Gulf are particularly sensitive. British national mariners should not dock or sail into waters around these islands.  </p>\n\n<p>When in the region, maintain a high state of awareness and be alert to local and regional tensions which may affect your route. Vessels may be at increased risk of maritime attack and harassment if they operate in the:   </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Gulf of Oman   </li>\n  <li>Northern Arabian Sea   </li>\n  <li>Persian Gulf   </li>\n  <li>Strait of Hormuz  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Iran has repeatedly attacked commercial vessels in nearby waters with military drones. One attack in 2021 resulted in the deaths of a British and a Romanian national. Vessels have also been seized and their crews detained in and around the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz in recent years.    </p>\n\n<p>If your vessel is hailed, provide the vessel name, flag state, and confirm they are exercising navigation rights and proceeding in accordance with international law, as reflected in the UNCLOS Convention. You should maintain high levels of awareness when you are operating in the area and report into <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ukmto.org/\">United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO)</a>.
