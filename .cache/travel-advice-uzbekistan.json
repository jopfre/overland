It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Uzbekistan’s current rules for the most common types of travel.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities in Uzbekistan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.uzembassy.uk/\">Uzbek Embassy in the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passport-validity-requirements\">Passport validity requirements</h2>\n\n<p>To enter Uzbekistan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the date you arrive.</p>\n\n<p>Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew\">Renew your passport</a> if you need to.</p>\n\n<p>You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document, or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"visa-requirements\">Visa requirements</h2>\n\n<p>You can visit Uzbekistan without a visa for tourism or business for up to 30 days.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re travelling for any other purpose, or intend to stay longer than 30 days, check the requirements with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.uzembassy.uk/\">Uzbek Embassy in the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re entering Uzbekistan on a visa, check it and carefully note the date of expiry and the number of entries permitted.</p>\n\n<p>Do not overstay your visa, or exceed your permitted duration of stay, even for a very short period. If you overstay, you could get a fine and possibly be deported. It is not always easy or possible to extend your stay or visa if you want to stay in the country for longer than planned. If you’re travelling overland, make sure you arrive at your intended border crossing in good time before your period of stay or visa expires.</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Warning\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry.   </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Border guards check the stamp on exit to make sure that travellers have not exceeded the 30-day period.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"registering-with-the-authorities\">Registering with the authorities</h2>\n\n<p>You must register with the local district <abbr title=\"Department of Foreign Travel and Exit\">OVIR</abbr> (Department of Foreign Travel and Exit) within 3 days of your arrival. Saturdays and Sundays count as part of the 3-day period. If you travel to another city and plan to stay for longer than 3 days there, you’ll need to register again.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re staying at a hotel, the staff will register you. If you’re staying in a private house, your host should register you with their local district <abbr title=\"Department of Foreign Travel and Exit\">OVIR</abbr> or on the electronic registration system, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.emehmon.uz/\">Emehmon</a>. Tourist tax is usually included in the hotel bill, and private hosts pay the tourist tax on behalf of the guest.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re travelling in Uzbekistan in a camper van or staying in tents and camping, you must register yourself. Register online through the electronic registration system, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.emehmon.uz/\">Emehmon</a>, within 3 days of arrival. When registering online, you’ll have to pay a tourist tax charge for each day of your stay. At the moment you can only pay the tourist tax online with an Uzbek debit card in local currency.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities will require a full record of where you’ve been in Uzbekistan upon departure. If you are unable to account for your whereabouts, or fail to get registered, you could get a fine for each day that is missing or late and possibly be deported.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"uzbek-british-dual-nationality\">Uzbek-British dual nationality</h2>\n\n<p>If you enter Uzbekistan on an Uzbek passport and are also a British national, the British Embassy can only provide very limited assistance. Uzbekistan does not recognise dual nationality so will treat you as an Uzbek national only. If you’re arrested or detained, the authorities are unlikely to grant you access to British Embassy staff.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccine-requirements\">Vaccine requirements</h2>\n\n<p>For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/237/uzbekistan#Vaccine_recommendations\">TravelHealthPro’s Uzbekistan guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://customs.uz/en/page/%D1%9Ezbekiston-respublikasi-hududiga-kirib-kelayotgan-zhismoniy-shahslar-uchun-bozhhona-qoidalari\">goods you can take into or out of Uzbekistan</a> (in Uzbek, Russian and English). You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.</p>\n\n<p>You must fill in 2 copies of the customs declaration, and make sure customs officials sign and stamp both copies. You will need to show one copy at customs as you enter Uzbekistan and the other when you leave the country.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taking-money-and-valuables-into-and-out-of-uzbekistan\">Taking money and valuables into and out of Uzbekistan</h3>\n\n<p>You’ll need to complete a declaration form when you arrive and keep a copy only if you are declaring:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>precious metals and gemstones in quantities over 65 grams </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>significant amounts of money, the threshold being 10,000 US dollars</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Make sure customs officials sign and stamp both copies. You will need to show one copy at customs as you enter Uzbekistan and the other when you leave the country.</p>\n\n<p>If you carry currency or valuables that you did not declare on arrival, there is a risk that officials may confiscate them.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot leave Uzbekistan with more foreign currency than you brought with you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"medication\">Medication</h3>\n\n<p>Before you take any medication into Uzbekistan, check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://customs.uz/en/page/ayrim-horizhiy-davlatlarning-zhismoniy-shahslar-uchun-zhoriy-qilingan-bozhhona-qoidalari\">list of prohibited medicines and restricted medicines</a> (in Uzbek and Russian).</p>\n\n<p>Bring a doctor’s prescription if you travel with prescription medicines and declare them on your customs declaration form. Some non-prescription medicines in the UK cause problems on entry into Uzbekistan, including codeine. Possession can lead to civil or criminal proceedings if you have not declared them on arrival. Travellers at land borders are more likely to face problems.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drones\">Drones</h3>\n\n<p>The import and use of drones in Uzbekistan is largely prohibited, with some limited exceptions. You must get a licence to import drones and permission to use them before you arrive in Uzbekistan. If you import or use drones without permission, you can be fined or get a prison sentence. The authorities can also confiscate your equipment.</p>\n\n","slug":"entry-requirements","title":"Entry requirements"},{"body":"<h2 id=\"terrorism\">Terrorism</h2>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets.

After the 90 days, daily fees will be applied. You must declare the car at the point of entry. You must carry your vehicle registration document and insurance for driving in Uzbekistan.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Uzbekistan with a valid UK driving licence for 30 days. You’ll need to have both the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 version of the international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>You should get your licence and <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> translated into either Russian or Uzbek to make interaction with local authorities and traffic police easier.
