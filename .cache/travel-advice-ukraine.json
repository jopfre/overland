There are serious risks to life and health from contaminated water, unexploded munitions and debris.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Before the full-scale invasion, serious crime against foreigners was relatively rare, but incidents did occur, with some cases being racially motivated.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a victim of crime, report it to the police by calling 102.  <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> has <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukraine-list-of-interpreters\">a list of local translators in Ukraine</a>.

Foreigners may appear to be lucrative targets.</p>\n\n<p>Theft of and from vehicles is common. Do not leave documents or money in your vehicle.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking\">Drink and food spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Do not leave drinks or food unattended as they could be spiked. Beware of accepting drinks from casual acquaintances.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Cloning of credit and debit cards is common. Be aware of who is around you when using ATMs and do not let your card out of your sight during transactions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cyber-attacks\">Cyber attacks</h3>\n\n<p>In December 2023, there was a high-impact cyber attack on Ukrainian networks. Ukraine’s largest mobile network operator, Kyivstar, suffered a cyber attack which left users without a mobile signal or the ability to use the internet. It also disrupted air raid apps, some banks, ATMs, and point-of-sale terminals. The Ukrainian bank Monobank was also targeted, disrupting access to the bank’s website.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"language\">Language</h3>\n\n<p>Ukrainian officials generally only speak Ukrainian and Russian.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Carry your passport at all times to use as identification and to demonstrate your legal status in Ukraine if asked by the police. Police should identify themselves and show identification. If you’re detained because you have not been able to present your passport, ask for an official report.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"access-to-money\">Access to money</h3>\n\n<p>ATMs are available and credit cards are widely used in cities. However, as a result of the current invasion of Ukraine by Russia, ATMs might not be refilled with cash and some bank cards might not be accepted. During power cuts, ATMs and card terminals may not work.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have sufficient cash in local currency. US dollars and euros are the easiest currencies to exchange in Ukraine. You may be able to exchange sterling, but in fewer places. Scottish and Northern Irish notes are not accepted. Only use official exchange booths and make sure you’re given a receipt. You’ll need to present your passport to exchange currency worth 150,000 Ukrainian hryvnia or more. You’ll need the receipt to exchange money back on departure.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk that cyber attacks could disrupt mobile, internet and banking services.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-and-smoking\">Alcohol and smoking</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to smoke or drink alcohol in public places, including on public transport, at bus stops, underground crossings, cultural, sports and governmental establishments, playgrounds and parks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Penalties for being caught in possession of drugs are severe.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Do not take photographs near government or military establishments.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Although same-sex relationships are not illegal, public attitudes are less tolerant than in the UK and showing affection in public may receive negative attention. There’s no provision under Ukrainian legislation guaranteeing freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.

If you want to bring your child born through surrogacy from Ukraine to the UK, you must <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports\">apply for a full British passport</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot facilitate your departure from Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>If you are considering changing your surrogacy arrangements, or making a new arrangement with a Ukrainian woman in another country, you should read about <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surrogacy-overseas/surrogacy-overseas\">surrogacy arrangements in foreign countries</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-information-and-risks\">Transport information and risks</h2>\n\n<p>Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, expect disruption to travel and transport networks. Only travel if you judge it is safe to do so. We cannot confirm which services are operating. Where possible, check before travelling.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Unregulated taxi drivers can overcharge. Use official taxis, which have the name and telephone number of the taxi company on the side of the door and on the top of the taxi.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Ukraine, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/ukraine/\">RAC’s Ukraine guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You must have a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> as well as your UK driving licence to drive in Ukraine. The 1949 <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> is not accepted any more. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. </p>\n\n<p>You need to carry a green card to drive in Ukraine. A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-insurance/driving-abroad\">green card</a> is proof that you have vehicle insurance when driving abroad. </p>\n\n<p>You must carry original vehicle registration papers, ownership documents and insurance papers at all times. You must show them when crossing borders and if you are stopped by the police. This also applies to rental vehicles. If you do not have these papers when stopped by the police they have the right to impound your vehicle and charge you for this.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"car-hire\">Car hire </h3>\n\n<p>If you intend to rent a vehicle for your travel in Ukraine, check with the car hire company and insurance company about their policy on renting cars in Ukraine and any other country you will pass through, especially non-EU countries. Ensure they provide you with a rental agreement permitting you to cross the Ukrainian border.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-standards\">Driving standards</h3>\n\n<p>Roads are of variable quality and routes may be affected by the ongoing invasion. Avoid night-time travel wherever possible.</p>\n\n<p>Local driving standards are poor. Street lights are weak and road users often ignore speed limits, traffic lights and road signs. Drivers frequently make turns and change lane without indicating.  There are a high number of traffic accidents, including fatalities. Speeding, drink driving and infrequent use of helmets, seat belts and child restraints in vehicles are the main contributing factors.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a road accident, you must wait for the police to assess the accident. Call the police on 102. Local officials generally only speak Ukrainian and Russian.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-regulations\">Driving regulations</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to drive with any alcohol content in your blood.</p>\n\n<p>Police can stop vehicles and give fines for minor offences such as illegal parking or jumping a red light. They may carry a credit card terminal to collect payment on the spot, or fines can be paid online or at a bank within 15 days. See <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://police.kiev.ua/statti/203-yak-splatiti-shtraf-pdr\">payment options</a> (in Ukrainian). The police officer should give their name and rank, explain why you have been stopped and make an administrative offence report. The police may film interactions with members of the public.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"leaving-ukraine-by-car\">Leaving Ukraine by car</h3>\n\n<p>You can leave Ukraine by car through most border crossing points, but Ukraine’s border crossings with Russia and Belarus are closed to regular traffic.</p>\n\n<p>There could be long queues at the border crossing points with EU member states and Moldova. Have a good supply of food, water, warm clothing, medication and fuel.</p>\n\n<p>The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine (SBGSU) website has a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://dpsu.gov.ua/en/map\">map showing the border crossing locations</a>.
