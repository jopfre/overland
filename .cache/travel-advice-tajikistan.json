You may be asked to provide proof of hotel bookings and any arrangements booked through a tour operator to be issued with a tourist visa.</p>\n\n<p>If you overstay your visa, you will not be allowed to leave Tajikistan until you get an exit visa. You can pay for an exit visa at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Consular Office. You may also get a fine, depending on how long you have overstayed.

If you need to stay longer, you must get a longer visa from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.consular.tj/default_en.aspx\">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> once you arrive.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"registering-with-the-authorities\">Registering with the authorities</h2>\n\n<p>If you are staying in Tajikistan for longer than 10 days, you must register with the Office for Registration of Foreign Citizens (OVIR) located at 5 Mirzo Tursunzoda Street, Dushanbe. Hotels are no longer permitted to complete the registration on your behalf. If you later stay at different addresses, you must register again separately.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not follow the registration procedure, you may not be allowed to leave Tajikistan until your registration process is resolved.

If you’re in the UK, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mfa.tj/en/london\">Tajik Embassy</a> to apply for a permit before you travel. If you’re in Tajikistan, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.consular.tj/default_en.aspx\">Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>The Tajikistan government sometimes stops issuing permits to tourists at short notice due to security concerns.

Take the same precautions you would in the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rape-and-sexual-assault\">Rape and sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>There have been cases of sexual assault, including rape, reported to the British Embassy. This includes suspected use of ‘date rape’ drugs targeting foreigners. Alcohol and drugs can lead to you being less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>not leave drinks unattended</li>\n  <li>not accept drinks from strangers</li>\n  <li>be aware of how much you are drinking</li>\n  <li>not accept lifts from strangers or acquaintances at any time</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"intimidation-at-dushanbe-international-airport\">Intimidation at Dushanbe International Airport</h2>\n\n<p>There have been cases of harassment by officials at Dushanbe International Airport. This includes requests for payment for allegedly incorrect documentation or other offences. Check with your hotel that your documentation and papers are in order before passing through border control at the airport. If you’re harassed or intimidated, report it to your travel agent or the consular bureau at the airport.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>Tajikistan has a secular constitution. (A secular state claims to treat all its citizens equally regardless of religion.) Most Tajik citizens are Muslims. Some, particularly in rural areas, may be conservative in outlook. Be aware of local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Always carry a copy of your passport’s photo page, as officials often ask for ID. You can present a copy rather than an original passport if a police officer asks you on the street.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking-ban\">Smoking ban</h3>\n\n<p>Although rarely enforced, smoking while walking on the street is illegal and punishable by a fine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Possession and use of drugs is illegal. If found guilty, you could get a lengthy prison sentence in very basic conditions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"woman-travelling-alone\">Woman travelling alone</h3>\n\n<p>Women travelling alone in Tajikistan may receive unwanted attention, harassment or difficulties based on gender. Consider not going out alone at night. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">advice for women travelling abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Taking photos of anything related to the military or security may get you into trouble with the authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drones\">Drones</h3>\n\n<p>The possession or use of UAVs (drones) is prohibited without permission from the Tajik National Security Committee. If you are found using drones without permission, you may be detained and your equipment confiscated.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex sexual activity is not illegal under Tajik law. However, local attitudes are conservative and the levels of tolerance and acceptance in society may vary, particularly outside the main cities. Take care about showing affection in public. Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"money\">Money</h3>\n\n<p>Tajikistan is mainly a cash-only economy. Very few businesses accept credit cards and none accept travellers cheques.</p>\n\n<p>Only change money at officially authorised currency exchanges. US dollars are the most widely accepted foreign currency. Euros or Russian roubles are also easy to exchange. It may be difficult to exchange other currencies.</p>\n\n<p>There is an increasing number of ATMs in Dushanbe and other larger towns, but none in rural areas. Most ATMs only accept Visa cards.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Tajikistan, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll need to have both the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 version of the international driving permit (<abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-standards\">Driving standards</h3>\n\n<p>Vehicles in Tajikistan are often poorly maintained and driving standards are basic. Petrol stations are rare outside towns and there are no breakdown companies. Make sure you take all you need for your journey and allow for delays. Consider bringing a satellite phone for travel outside towns to use in an emergency. Neighbouring countries may close borders temporarily.</p>\n\n<p>Roads outside the main towns are poorly maintained and often only accessible by 4-wheel-drive vehicles. Conditions are particularly dangerous in spring due to the risk of avalanches and landslides.</p>\n\n<p>Many interior roads are only open in the summer months. It is possible to drive from Dushanbe to the north and Tajikistan’s second city, Khujand, using a tunnel. This road is particularly dangerous in winter due to icy conditions. Drivers can be trapped for a long time if caught in an avalanche due to the remote location.</p>\n\n<p>Flooding in the spring and winter often damages and closes roads in areas of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region and other parts of the country. Many roads, including the Pamir Highway, are open but not fully repaired.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>In 2022, the UK sanctioned Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines. It is now illegal under UK law for any British national or British company to do business with these airlines. This includes the purchasing of flight tickets.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Earthquakes are a risk in Tajikistan. Most are small and affect remote areas of the country, particularly the east in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. Avalanches and landslides often block roads in the spring and early summer. Learn earthquake safety procedures and follow the advice of the local authorities. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>In late spring and summer, there can be seasonal flooding and mudslides caused by melting glaciers.
