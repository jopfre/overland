However, from 15 August British nationals entering Honduras are required to have a visa. Check with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://hondurasembassyuk.com/visa/\">Honduran Embassy</a> in London for information on how this CA-4 agreement would be applied to you.</p>\n\n<p>The 90-day period starts when you enter any of these countries and does not restart when you cross borders. You’ll have to go through immigration checks at borders. If you’re expelled from one of these countries, you’re also excluded from the other 3.</p>\n\n<p>In Nicaragua, you can extend your stay by up to 30 days by paying a fee before the 90 days expires.

It is illegal for foreigners to take part in any sort of political activity in Nicaragua. You can be arrested and detained or deported for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>taking part in a protest</li>\n  <li>breach of the peace</li>\n  <li>any activity seen as acting against the government, including political meetings and campaigns</li>\n  <li>using Nicaragua’s national flag or colours (blue and white) for campaigning or protesting</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Demonstrations can also lead to travel disruption. Check local information before travelling.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-crime\">Violent crime</h3>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals have been affected by violent crime in Nicaragua. Criminals often carry out attacks on people in vehicles. To reduce the risk to yourself and your belongings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>keep the windows of your car closed and the doors locked</li>\n  <li>avoid public transport after dark</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Take care when walking around markets, bus stations, around the old cathedral in Managua and in the poorer areas of towns.

If you report the incident to the police, get a signed and stamped copy of the police report.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxi-safety-and-criminal-kidnap\">Taxi safety and criminal kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There is a risk of ‘express kidnapping’ if you use an unauthorised taxi. You could be taken hostage and forced to pay cash for your release.</p>\n\n<p>Reduce the risk by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>using a radio-dispatched taxi or an authorised taxi with red plates</li>\n  <li>making sure the driver’s ID number, name and photograph are clearly visible on the dashboard</li>\n  <li>making a note of the colour and number of the vehicle before you get in</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is a common local practice to share taxis with strangers, but tourists have been robbed when taking taxis called by strangers. Do not take a taxi if it has been called for you by someone you do not know well. You should also avoid using ‘colectivos’ (minibuses).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re a woman, use hotels that have staff at the front desk 24 hours a day and have adequate security measures.

There are often money changers with official identification at the front of banks, where there is likely to be better security. You can also withdraw cash in US dollars or Nicaraguan cordobas from ATMs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Do not become involved with drugs of any kind.

There’s a risk of drivers failing to give way and driving dangerously, including under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions are generally poor. There is no street lighting on the main highways between major cities and only minimal street lighting in towns. Avoid driving at night.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re involved in a serious or fatal road traffic accident, you’re likely to be detained while it is investigated.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"boat-and-ferry-travel\">Boat and ferry travel</h3>\n\n<p>Although local law requires operators of water transport to have insurance, some still do not carry recognised insurance. Check the operator’s insurance cover before beginning your journey.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a> for information about how to prepare, and how to react if there is a warning.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hurricanes\">Hurricanes</h3>\n\n<p>The hurricane season normally runs from June to November.
