These have included improvised explosive device (<abbr title=\"Improvised explosive device\">IED</abbr>) attacks in major cities.</p>\n\n<p>The Bangladeshi authorities continue to work to disrupt planned attacks. Increases in security force presence and restrictions on movement may be put in place at short notice.</p>\n\n<p>You should remain aware of your surroundings, particularly in and around police buildings. Avoid large gatherings and other locations with a police or security presence. Follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>In July and August 2024, there has been widespread violence across Bangladesh, resulting in deaths and injuries.</p>\n\n<p>The situation remains volatile. Political rallies and demonstrations continue to take place. These can quickly turn violent leading to clashes with law enforcement. During demonstrations and strikes (‘hartals’), there can be arson, violence and vandalism in towns and cities across the country, which can result in fatalities. Attacks against property and public transport are possible.</p>\n\n<p>Be alert to quickly changing situations on the streets. If you see a demonstration starting, move to a place of safety.

Thieves often work in pairs on motorcycles or motorised rickshaws known as ‘CNGs’.</p>\n\n<p>Potential threats include armed robbery, violent crime and rape.</p>\n\n<p>Passengers using rickshaws, taxis, buses or trains are vulnerable to violent crime, particularly at night.

When walking in public, do not use a mobile phone. Avoid carrying or showing large amounts of money, or wearing expensive-looking jewellery or watches.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dhaka-and-sylhet-airports\">Dhaka and Sylhet airports</h3>\n\n<p>Dhaka international and Sylhet airports are fully operational. Check with your travel provider for updates.</p>\n\n<p>Risks at Dhaka and Sylhet airports include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>theft, including passport theft</li>\n  <li>harassment</li>\n  <li>taxi drivers overcharging or robbing customers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To reduce your risk:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid touts offering to carry your bags</li>\n  <li>keep documents and belongings safe</li>\n  <li>arrange taxis in advance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>Bangladesh is a majority Muslim country. Respect the local traditions, customs and laws. Make sure your actions do not cause offence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Local officials may ask you for ID.</p>\n\n<p>Carry copies of the photo page in your passport and your Bangladeshi visa. Keep the originals somewhere safe and leave copies with friends or relatives in the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code\">Dress code</h3>\n\n<p>Both men and women should dress modestly to avoid causing offence. Women should cover their shoulders and legs in public.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan in 2025 is expected to start around the first day of March and last until the end of March.</p>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. Get advice on respecting Ramadan from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes – clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time, both for women and men</li>\n  <li>be aware that fasting can cause tiredness, particularly during the later afternoon and early evening</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"british-nationals-of-bangladeshi-origin\">British nationals of Bangladeshi origin</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re a British national of Bangladeshi origin, the Bangladeshi government will consider you to be a Bangladeshi citizen, even if you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>have never had a Bangladeshi passport</li>\n  <li>were born outside of Bangladesh</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This may limit the help the UK government can offer you.

A liquor permit allows you to drink alcohol in government-licensed bars. Check the requirements at your local district office and apply for a permit if necessary.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-penalties\">Illegal drugs penalties</h3>\n\n<p>There are severe penalties for possessing and trafficking illegal drugs. Some drug-related offences are punishable by the death penalty or life imprisonment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"prison-sentences-and-conditions\">Prison sentences and conditions</h3>\n\n<p>If you break local laws, you may get a prison sentence, served in a local prison. Delays and inefficiency in the judicial system can result in long detentions until court hearings eventually take place. Prison conditions are far below UK standards.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals detained in Bangladesh have the right to request access to British High Commission officials.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"family-law-and-property-disputes\">Family law and property disputes</h3>\n\n<p>Family law in Bangladesh is very different from UK law.

You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-standards\">Driving standards</h3>\n\n<p>Bangladesh has a high rate of road accidents, mainly because:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>driving standards are poor</li>\n  <li>many vehicles are unlicensed and not roadworthy</li>\n  <li>mandatory vehicle safety checks are often ignored</li>\n  <li>a large number of rickshaws use the roads and ignore traffic laws</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Driving at night is especially dangerous as many drivers do not use headlights or use undipped headlights. There is also a risk of robbery if you travel between towns after dark. Avoid driving alone at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cycle-rickshaws-and-taxis\">Cycle rickshaws and taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Cycle rickshaws are not safe – they offer little protection if there is an accident.</p>\n\n<p>Police are often unable to verify private hire drivers’ details, as driving records are often inaccurate.</p>\n\n<p>Ride-hailing apps like Uber are available in Bangladesh. To make sure you get in the right car safely:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>wait in a safe location, not out on the street</li>\n  <li>match the car’s registration plate, make and model</li>\n  <li>ask the driver to state your name</li>\n  <li>check the driver’s photo</li>\n  <li>share your journey details and consider enabling <abbr title=\"Global Positioning System\">GPS</abbr> tracking on your phone so trusted contacts can see your location</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"buses\">Buses</h3>\n\n<p>The risks of travelling by bus include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>extremely poor maintenance and driving standards</li>\n  <li>frequent traffic collisions, some resulting in deaths</li>\n  <li>rape, sexual assaults and other crimes, sometimes committed by the bus crew</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling by bus alone and at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Due to the security situation in Bangladesh, there are frequent disruptions to air travel, often at short notice. Stay in touch with your airline. Security checks at the airport can also be slow.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, an attempted hijacking took place of a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight from Dhaka to Dubai via Chittagong. The Bangladesh Civil Aviation Ministry has completed its investigation into the incident. Extra security measures are in place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>The rail network is extensive but old and generally considered slow.</p>\n\n<p>Rail travel risks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>frequent fatal accidents</li>\n  <li>flood-damaged bridges and culverts in dangerous condition</li>\n  <li>crime, including theft and sexual assault</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>On some trains, you may be able to lock first-class compartment doors.
