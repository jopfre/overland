Local transport routes may be disrupted.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>The Republic of Cyprus is a full EU member, but the country is divided by the ‘Green Line’.

If you might be eligible for any local obligations or duties that apply to dual nationals, such as military service, contact the Cypriot authorities or a local lawyer before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>The British High Commission has lists of English-speaking lawyers in Cyprus and in the north of Cyprus.

Surrogacy is a complex and lengthy process.

If you want to bring your child born through surrogacy from Cyprus to the UK, you must <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports\">apply for a full British passport</a>. You will need a Cypriot birth certificate to apply. The maximum period of visa-free stay allowed by the Cypriot authorities is 90 days within a 180-day period.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"international-parental-child-abduction\">International parental child abduction</h3>\n\n<p>The authorities in the north of Cyprus do not act on British court orders. They will not share information with the British High Commission on children subject to UK court orders. This means the British High Commission cannot ensure that these children are properly safeguarded.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid taking photographs near sensitive areas, such as military buildings. If you do, the authorities could arrest you.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-safety\">Swimming safety</h3>\n\n<p>Bathing is generally safe, but there can be strong waves and currents.

If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence\">update it to a photocard licence</a> or get the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">correct version of the international driving permit (IDP)</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p>You must display a UK sticker to drive a UK-based car in Cyprus.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-standards\">Driving standards</h3>\n\n<p>Driving standards are poor and there is an increased risk of road deaths compared to the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"car-and-motorbike-hire\">Car and motorbike hire</h3>\n\n<p>Cars hired in the Republic of Cyprus often have no insurance cover in the north of the island. Check with your insurance company as you will not be allowed through a crossing without the correct insurance documents. At some crossing points it is possible to buy car insurance for the north of Cyprus. This includes the Agios Dometios.</p>\n\n<p>Hire companies renting mopeds and quad bikes usually only provide third-party insurance, so you will have to pay for any damage to the vehicle.
