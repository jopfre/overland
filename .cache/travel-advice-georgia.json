This applies whether you are on a visitor’s permit or officially resident. You’ll be fined if you do not comply.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travel-insurance\">Travel insurance</h2>\n\n<p>All visitors to Georgia must have appropriate travel insurance to cover all healthcare needs during their visit. You may be asked for evidence of this, either by your airline at check-in or by immigration authorities when you arrive in Georgia. You may face difficulties if you do not have this evidence.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">appropriate travel health insurance</a> and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad and repatriation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccine-requirements\">Vaccine requirements</h2>\n\n<p>For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/87/georgia#Vaccine_Recommendations\">TravelHealthPro’s Georgia guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules </h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rs.ge/LegalEntityCustomsProcedures-en?cat=1&amp;tab=1\">goods you can take into or out of Georgia</a>.

This can also cover prescription and non-prescription medicines commonly available in the UK. For example, non-prescription medicines containing codeine are illegal.</p>\n\n<p>This can cause serious problems for travellers and in some cases lead to prosecution.

Attacks could happen anywhere and affect western interests and places visited by foreigners, such as tourist sites and cultural events.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Since 28 November there have been daily political demonstrations, some leading to violent confrontation between police and protesters. In Tbilisi these are mainly on Rustaveli Avenue, Chavchavadze Avenue and Heroes’ Square and in other nearby areas, but they can begin or end at different locations across the city, disrupting traffic.  Demonstrations are taking place in other cities and towns. Crowd numbers tend to increase in the evening and some rallies extend into the night. </p>\n\n<p>Tensions can escalate without warning. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check local media</li>\n  <li>avoid large gatherings and demonstrations</li>\n  <li>follow the advice of local authorities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"crime\">Crime</h3>\n\n<p>Crime levels are low. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>take sensible precautious to avoid pick-pocketing, particularly in crowded places</li>\n  <li>not leave valuables unattended</li>\n  <li>stay aware of your surroundings</li>\n  <li>always keep your mobile phone charged and with you</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Georgian law protects everyone’s human rights and equality, but ethnic minorities and LGBT+ people may face discrimination. Harassment and assault based on race and sexuality do take place.</p>\n\n<p>If someone attempts to assault you or you feel threatened, call the emergency number 112 and ask for the police.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You are not legally required to always carry ID, but if the police or a service provider (hotel, bank etc) ask you for ID you are expected to show your passport.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-codes-and-behaviour-in-public\">Dress codes and behaviour in public</h3>\n\n<p>Tbilisi is a cosmopolitan city. There can be more conservative attitudes in rural areas. When travelling outside cities, be aware of cultural sensitivities around modest dress (particularly in places of worship) and showing affection in public.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"money\">Money</h3>\n\n<p>Prices may be quoted in US dollars and euros, but goods and services must be paid for in local currency (lari).</p>\n\n<p>Travellers’ cheques are rarely accepted. Outside major towns, you may not find ATMs or be able to use credit and debit cards. Take enough cash in lari if travelling to rural or remote areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>If you use illegal drugs of any kind, you can get heavy fines or long prison terms. Smuggling even very small amounts of drugs carries a prison term of 5 to 25 years and heavy fines.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras\">Using cameras</h3>\n\n<p>Do not photograph sensitive sites like military bases and power installations.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware of cultural sensitivities when photographing churches and other religious sites.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-drones\">Using Drones</h3>\n\n<p>You must <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://uas.gov.ge/EN\">register any drone with a video or audio recording system</a> at the Georgian Civil Aviation Agency before it can be used in a public place. To register you need your passport and a valid email address. Foreign nationals cannot register drones online, so you will need to do this in person at the Civil Aviation Agency office.</p>\n\n<p>You must get a special licence from the Civil Aviation Authority for any drone that weighs more than 250g but less than 25kg, even if it does not have a video or audio system.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex sexual activity is legal in Georgia, and there are anti-discrimination laws, but same-sex relationships are still not widely accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Showing affection in public may result in discrimination or harassment. Homophobic harassment and assault take place.</p>\n\n<p>Pride marches in 2019 and 2021 were cancelled because the police did not guarantee security. In 2023, a Pride event was cancelled after a violent protest.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"surrogacy\">Surrogacy</h3>\n\n<p>The Georgian Parliament is expected to adopt a law banning surrogacy for foreign couples soon. Keep up to date and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/georgia/email-signup\">get emails when we update Georgia travel advice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re visiting Georgia to arrange an international surrogacy, consider the risks and challenges involved. Surrogacy is a complex, lengthy process. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>make sure you’re aware of the facts and well-prepared before starting the process</li>\n  <li>get specialist legal advice on Georgian and UK laws before making any arrangements</li>\n  <li>read <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> and Home Office <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surrogacy-overseas\">guidance on surrogacy overseas</a>\n</li>\n  <li>research clinics and hospitals thoroughly to make sure they are safe and reputable</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The British Embassy cannot get involved in surrogacy arrangements or recommend hospitals or clinics.</p>\n\n<p>Commissioning a surrogacy will not automatically mean that the child holds British citizenship. To bring your child born through surrogacy from Georgia to the UK, you must <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports\">apply for a full British passport</a>. You need a Georgian birth certificate for this. Check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://psh.gov.ge/main/menus/1\">Public Service Hall</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://sda.gov.ge/?page_id=7313&amp;lang=en\">Service Development Agency</a> websites and research the rules for leaving the country with children (some legal details are in Georgian only). You can stay visa-free in Georgia for a continuous period of up to one year. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://geoconsul.gov.ge/\">Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> has more information.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"trade-with-south-ossetia-and-abkhazia\">Trade with South Ossetia and Abkhazia</h3>\n\n<p>Anyone trading with Abkhazia and South Ossetia must have a licence issued by the Georgia government. This includes buying and selling property and most financial transactions. Anyone trading without a licence may face penalties under Georgian civil and criminal law.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<p>Make sure your <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">travel insurance</a> covers your activities.</p>\n\n<p>If you get into trouble during hiking, skiing, adventure travel or extreme sports, the emergency response may be limited.</p>\n\n<p>Off-piste skiing is very dangerous. It can be difficult to get accurate information on mountain conditions, including avalanche risks. Read <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/winter-sports-stay-safe-on-the-slopes\">preparing for winter sports abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re doing extreme sports, consider going with specialist guides. Many insurance policies will not cover damage to rental equipment or skiing off-piste without a guide.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware that safety standards in Georgia may not be as high as those in the UK. For example, several people were injured when a ski lift at Gudauri malfunctioned in 2018 and a tourist helicopter crashed near Stepantsminda (Kazbegi) in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan to hike close to the administrative boundary lines, consider hiring a professional guide.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<p>Take usual precautions after dark in unfamiliar areas.</p>\n\n<p>Street lighting away from main roads can be poor and pavements uneven. There may be occasional short power cuts – consider carrying a torch.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Taxi provision and safety has improved significantly. To stay safe using taxis:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>do not flag taxis in the street</li>\n  <li>try to pre-book taxis through an app</li>\n  <li>check the taxi has working seatbelts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re planning to drive in Georgia, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a> and check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/georgia/\">rules of the road in the RAC’s Georgia guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can drive in Georgia with a UK driving licence for up to one year. If you’re hiring a car, check with the car hire company before you travel whether they will accept the UK licence or whether you will need a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 international driving permit (IDP)</a>. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Drink driving punishments can be severe. Georgia has a lower blood alcohol content limit than the UK, so avoid alcohol if driving.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-conditions\">Driving conditions</h3>\n\n<p>Take care when driving, especially at night. Be aware that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>roads outside city centres are often badly lit and poor quality</li>\n  <li>stray livestock can be a hazard</li>\n  <li>road markings and the right of way can be confusing</li>\n  <li>many cars are poorly maintained</li>\n  <li>driving can be erratic</li>\n  <li>heavy rain, flooding and snow at higher altitudes can affect roads and bridges making travel difficult or impossible (particularly in remote areas)</li>\n  <li>landslides are common</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you’re travelling outside Tbilisi, particularly in remote areas, make sure your vehicle is suitable for off-road driving and check weather conditions locally.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Take usual precautions with your personal safety and belongings.
