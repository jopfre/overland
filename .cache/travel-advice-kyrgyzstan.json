Most demonstrations are peaceful but occasionally turn violent, sometimes with little or no warning. On 17 and 18 May 2024, 41 people were injured in Bishkek in Kyrgyz protests against South Asian migrant workers and students.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid crowds and demonstrations, check for updates on local media and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-yourself-and-your-belongings\">Protecting yourself and your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Street crime is a risk, including bag-snatching and mugging. Take care if you go out alone, and consider using private cars or pre-arranged taxis at night.</p>\n\n<p>Do not show large amounts of money and be wary of strangers offering help or being over-friendly.</p>\n\n<p>Be careful when using currency exchange offices and visiting the bazaars in Bishkek, particularly Osh Bazaar, where pickpockets target tourists.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>There have been cases of sexual assault and harassment, including on public transport.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking\">Drink and food spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Drink spiking can happen in nightclubs and bars. Do not leave your drink or food unattended. See <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelaware.campaign.gov.uk/#stick_with_your_mates\">TravelAware ‘Stick with your mates’</a> for tips and advice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>Kyrgyzstan has a secular constitution. Most Kyrgyz people are Muslim. Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Make sure your actions do not offend other cultures or religious beliefs, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or when you visit religious sites.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You must always carry your passport, or a notarised copy of it. The police can arrest you if you do not carry ID. You can get a copy of your passport notarised in the UK and translated into Kyrgyz or Russian, or use a copy notarised in Kyrgyzstan.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to possess or use drugs. You could get a lengthy prison sentence if convicted. Prison conditions are basic.</p>\n\n<p>The police conduct regular drug raids in bars and night clubs. Police will be masked and armed. Stay calm and follow instructions. If you are not carrying and have not taken drugs you are normally asked for identification and then allowed to leave.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"e-cigarettes\">E-cigarettes</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to bring e-cigarettes, vaping devices and solutions into Kyrgyzstan or to buy and sell them. Customs officials will confiscate these items; and they could fine or detain you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-drones-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras and drones in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to take photos of or use drones near anything related to the military or security, including border checkpoints, military sites and police stations. Check carefully that you are not near any military or security facilities.</p>\n\n<p>Check if you can import and use your model of drone with the Kyrgyz Embassy.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"social-media\">Social media</h3>\n\n<p>Be careful when posting images of your visit on social media as offence can be taken. Take particular care with images or comments about public buildings, the Kyrgyz flag, national food or customs. Disrespectful content could result in fines or detention.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships are legal but not often discussed or recognised publicly. Showing affection in public could result in a violent attack or unwanted attention. Same sex marriages are not recognised in Kyrgyz law.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"power-cuts\">Power cuts</h3>\n\n<p>There are frequent power cuts throughout Kyrgyzstan during the winter.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"trekking-and-mountaineering\">Trekking and mountaineering</h3>\n\n<p>Trekking in Kyrgyzstan often involves travelling to very remote areas. There is a high risk of avalanches, landslides and rockfalls. Weather can change very quickly, and heavy snowfall can block roads and trekking routes, particularly in the autumn and winter.</p>\n\n<p>At higher altitudes there is a possibility of snow even in the summer months, and a risk of sunstroke, serious sunburn and altitude sickness.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>get adequate insurance, including for any activity at high altitude</li>\n  <li>use a reputable trekking agency</li>\n  <li>let someone know when you plan to return</li>\n  <li>not trek alone</li>\n  <li>adapt your plans to reflect local conditions and advice</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In remote areas, mobile phone or satellite phone coverage can be extremely limited. Medical facilities are basic, and difficult terrain can in some circumstances make it impossible for emergency services to reach you.</p>\n\n<p>There is a basic mountain rescue service staffed by volunteers. The rescue equipment they have is limited. Mountain rescue 24-hour emergency number: +996 312 651 404.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel </h3>\n\n<p>If you’re planning to drive a hire car or a UK vehicle, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a>. </p>\n\n<p>You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Kyrgyzstan for up to 30 days. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence\">update it to a photocard licence</a> or get the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">correct version of the international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p>You’re legally required to have third-party insurance. For more information, contact insurance companies in Kyrgyzstan.</p>\n\n<p>Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a minimum of one year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>Drink-driving is a serious offence in Kyrgyzstan. If you are tested and found to have any alcohol in your system, you may be fined and have your licence revoked for 1 year.</p>\n\n<p>If the police stop you and issue a fine, they should give you a paper copy with instructions on how to pay. You can pay fines through a payment terminal or in a bank. Do not pay cash directly to police officers, although some may have a payment terminal you can use. Some fines may be reduced if you pay quickly. Payment terminals are available on streets and other places such as malls, grocery stores, kiosks and restaurants.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-safety\">Driving safety</h3>\n\n<p>Many roads are poorly lit and not maintained, with road works or damaged roads often not clearly signposted. Watch out for pedestrians as they often have a low awareness of road safety. Roads outside of Bishkek are often blocked by snow in winter.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra care when driving, particularly over long distances and avoid giving lifts to hitchhikers. Drivers have been robbed by people they picked up.</p>\n\n<p>Road conditions can be poor in and around Bishkek, wherever possible use main roads when travelling.</p>\n\n<p>Petrol stations are limited in rural areas and diesel is often unavailable. Make sure you take all you need for your journey.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis-and-buses\">Taxis and buses</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid flagging down taxis. Use pre-ordered  taxi services, which are more reputable and have English-speaking dispatchers.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid using local buses and minibuses if possible. They are not always maintained properly and pickpockets operate on them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel   </h3>\n\n<p>In May 2022, the UK sanctioned Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines. It is now illegal under UK law for any British national or British company to do business with these airlines. This includes buying flight tickets.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> (ASL) lists all known airlines in Kyrgyzstan that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Check whether your tour operator has concerns about airlines in Kyrgyzstan.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>There is a high risk of earthquakes and tremors are frequent. Familiarise yourself with safety procedures and follow advice from local authorities. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has information about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"avalanches-and-landslides\">Avalanches and landslides</h3>\n\n<p>In the mountains, avalanches and landslides often block roads, particularly in the spring.</p>\n\n","slug":"safety-and-security","title":"Safety and security"},{"body":"<p>This section has safety advice for regions of Kyrgyzstan.
