You can pay this fine at the main <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://igm.gob.gt/\">Institute of Migration</a> (in Spanish) office in Guatemala City. You can also pay fines at the airport or land borders, but administrative processes can cause serious delays.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"applying-for-or-extending-a-visa\">Applying for or extending a visa</h3>\n\n<p>To stay longer than 90 days (to work or study, for business travel or for other reasons), you must meet the Guatemalan government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">Guatemalan Embassy in the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to extend  your visa or permit to stay, you must apply to the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://igm.gob.gt/\">Institute of Migration</a> (Spanish language website).</p>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Warning\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>Make sure you get your passport stamped on entry. </p>\n</div>\n\n<p>If you do not get your passport stamped when you arrive, you will get a fine and be delayed on your departure.

This is normally included in the price of your ticket.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"travelling-with-children\">Travelling with children </h2>\n\n<p>To enter or exit Guatemala, children aged 17 and under travelling alone or with only one parent or legal guardian must have a notarised letter in Spanish from the parents or guardians not travelling with them. Contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk\">Guatemalan Embassy</a>, or if you’re in Guatemala the nearest <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://igm.gob.gt/\">Institute of Migration</a> (Spanish language website), for information about what documents you need.

The 90-day period starts when you enter any of these countries and does not restart when you cross borders. You can extend your stay by up to 30 days by paying a fee before the 90 days expires. If you overstay, you may get a fine. </p>\n\n<p>You’ll have to go through immigration checks at borders. If you’re expelled from one of these countries, you’re also excluded from the other 2.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"illegal-entry-fees-at-land-borders\">Illegal entry fees at land borders</h2>\n\n<p>Guatemalan customs or immigration officials sometimes ask travellers crossing land borders to pay an ‘entry fee’. This is illegal. If you are asked to pay a fee, ask for an official receipt, and you may find the officials drop the request.</p>\n\n<p>When crossing into Guatemala by the land border at El Carmen, be wary of people offering to help process your entry into the country. They may be trying to overcharge you for unnecessary services.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccine-requirements\">Vaccine requirements</h2>\n\n<p>To enter Guatemala, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission\">country listed as a transmission risk</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country-details.php?cnt=96#Vaccine_Recommendations\">TravelHealthPro’s Guatemala guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Guatemala. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"taking-money-into-guatemala\">Taking money into Guatemala</h2>\n\n<p>It is often not possible to exchange British pounds in Guatemala. It is much easier to exchange US dollars.</p>\n\n","slug":"entry-requirements","title":"Entry requirements"},{"body":"<p>This guide also has safety advice for <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/guatemala/regional-risks\">regions of Guatemala</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"terrorism\">Terrorism</h2>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.</p>\n\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorism-in-guatemala\">Terrorism in Guatemala</h3>\n\n<p>Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Guatemala, attacks cannot be ruled out.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation  </h2>\n\n<p>Incidents of political violence, strikes and large demonstrations can occur, often with little or no notice. Most demonstrations are peaceful, but they can turn violent. Protestors may block roads and public facilities, including the international airport, without notice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Guatemala has one of the highest violent crime rates in Latin America. Although most of the serious crime involves local gangs, you could be caught up in incidents as they can happen in tourist areas.</p>\n\n<p>No parts of Guatemala City are free from crime, including Zone 10 (Zona Viva), which is popular with tourists and foreign residents. Take care in Zone 1 where tourists have been targeted by criminals, this is the historical centre where cheaper hotels are located and several bus routes end.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-crime\">Violent crime</h3>\n\n<p>Violent attacks, including sexual assault and gun crime, can take place anywhere and at any time of the day. Attackers have killed and injured victims who resisted. There is a low arrest and conviction rate.</p>\n\n<p>Carjacking and armed robbery are common on the main road (Carretera Salvador) leading from Guatemala City to the border with El Salvador.</p>\n\n<p>There have been armed attacks on tourists travelling by road to and from major tourist sites like Antigua, Tikal, Petén and Lake Atitlán. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/guatemala/regional-risks\">Regional risks</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-yourself-and-your-belongings\">Protecting yourself and your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>You can take precautions such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>not displaying valuables like laptops, cameras and mobile phones</li>\n  <li>not wearing a lot of jewellery</li>\n  <li>carrying only small amounts of cash – avoid withdrawing a lot of money, particularly at night</li>\n  <li>keeping valuables safe (for example, in a hotel safe)</li>\n  <li>not travelling alone or at night, especially near borders or in areas without many people</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you go to remote areas, it may be safer to travel with others or a reputable tour company.</p>\n\n<p>For shorter trips within towns and cities the safest option is to take radio-dispatched taxis (which are usually yellow) or hotel taxis. You can buy pre-paid taxi vouchers from the office of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://inguat.gob.gt/\"><abbr title=\"Instituto Guatemalteco de Turismo\">INGUAT</abbr>, Guatemala’s tourist agency</a> (Spanish language website) in the airport’s arrivals terminal.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re driving, it is generally safer to travel on main roads. There is a greater risk of attack by gangs on quieter routes. Travel in convoy if possible.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware of your surroundings and take care around ATMs, petrol station forecourts, the airport, bus stations and shopping centres.</p>\n\n<p>You can get up-to-date security information from <abbr title=\"Instituto Guatemalteco de Turismo\">INGUAT</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a victim of a criminal attack, <abbr title=\"Instituto Guatemalteco de Turismo\">INGUAT</abbr> has a tourist assistance and emergency service section called <abbr title=\"Programa Nacional de Asistencia al Turista\">PROATUR</abbr> who can help accompany you to your hotel or other safe place. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/guatemala/getting-help\">Getting help</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buses-and-coaches\">Buses and coaches</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling on public buses (repainted US school buses). There has been an increase in armed attacks by local gangs on bus drivers and conductors, often resulting in serious injury or death. These attacks have included the use of explosives. There have also been violent muggings, rapes and assaults against foreigners.</p>\n\n<p>Private intercity coach services are generally safer, but gangs have also attacked these during daylight hours, even on main roads.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"atm-tampering\">ATM tampering</h3>\n\n<p>Check ATMs for evidence of tampering. Affected machines may not be easy to spot. It’s safer to change money in hotels, at banks or at foreign exchange offices.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fake-police-officers\">Fake police officers</h3>\n\n<p>Criminals posing as police officers have committed theft, extortion and sexual assault against visitors to Guatemala. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Foreign visitors are at risk of scams. Scams come in many forms and can lead to great financial loss. Warn your friends and family to be sceptical if they’re asked to transfer funds to you in Guatemala. Tell them to contact you to check that you’ve made this request.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"criminal-kidnapping\">Criminal kidnapping  </h3>\n\n<p>Express kidnappings – short term opportunistic abductions, aimed at extracting cash from the victim – are common in Guatemala. Victims can be targeted or selected at random. They are held while criminals withdraw money from their bank accounts using their cash cards. Many cases involve victims that have been picked up by taxis (registered or illegal) hailed from the street. Be aware of your surroundings and always let someone you trust know your whereabouts, especially after dark.</p>\n\n<p>Business people and visitors perceived to be wealthy may be targeted by kidnappers in search of payouts. Be discreet about discussing your financial or business affairs in places where you may be overheard by others, and when arranging meetings use a secure location.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a victim of kidnapping, follow the kidnapper’s instructions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>It is a legal requirement to always carry ID. In most parts of the country, you can carry a copy of your passport’s photo page for identification purposes. In San Pedro La Laguna, Sololá, local authorities may not accept a copy and may fine or detain you if you cannot show your original passport or a certified copy. Always co-operate with military and police officers and be prepared for checkpoints.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to sell alcoholic and fermented beverages from 1am to 6am. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>There are severe penalties for drug trafficking and the use of drugs. Guatemalan prisons are overcrowded, violent and dirty.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taking-photos-without-permission\">Taking photos without permission</h3>\n\n<p>Do not take photographs without permission, especially of children. This is particularly important in more remote areas such as Quiché, Petén, San Marcos and Chiquimula provinces. There have been attacks related to accusations and fears of child kidnapping for adoption or theft of vital organs. Foreigners have been caught up in the violence. You may need to pay a small amount of money to take photographs of both children and adults.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same sex sexual activity is not illegal, although there are no laws guaranteeing freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Same-sex marriages are not recognised in Guatemala. In Guatemala City, local people are largely tolerant of LGBT+ people. Outside Guatemala City, attitudes are more conservative. Showing affection in public may bring verbal and physical attacks, harassment and discrimination.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"climbing-volcanoes\">Climbing volcanoes</h3>\n\n<p>Before you climb volcanoes, visit the websites of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.insivumeh.gob.gt/\">Guatemalan Meteorological Office</a> (Spanish language website) and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://conred.gob.gt/\"><abbr title=\"Coordinadora Nacional para la Reducción de Desastres\">CONRED</abbr>, Guatemala’s disaster agency</a> for information on access, restrictions and recommendations.</p>\n\n<p>Follow the advice of local authorities. Some volcanoes are at high altitude with freezing temperatures at night. Tourists have died of exposure on volcanoes in Guatemala. Warm clothing and waterproofs are essential. Local tour organisers tend to underestimate the risks. There is no mountain rescue service. </p>\n\n<p>See more information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/safer-adventure-travel-and-volunteering-overseas\">Volunteering and adventure travel</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>. </p>\n\n<p>You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Guatemala for up to 3 months. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence\">update it to a photocard licence</a> or get the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">correct version of the international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p>Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-rules-and-safety\">Driving rules and safety</h3>\n\n<p>In Guatemala:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>it is illegal to use a mobile phone while driving</li>\n  <li>speed limits are strictly enforced</li>\n  <li>motorcyclists must wear an orange vest and helmet with the registration number or face a fine of 1,000 Guatemalan quetzal (around £100)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Drink-driving is a serious offence. If you are tested and found to have any alcohol in your system, you may get a fine, your licence confiscated and possible imprisonment. However, drinking-driving is common in Guatemala.</p>\n\n<p>In more isolated locations, roads are unpaved and you may need a 4-wheel drive vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re involved in an accident, contact the National Police (telephone: 110) or the fire brigade (telephone: 122 or 123) and wait for them to arrive. PROVIAL (telephone: +502 2419 2121 or 1520), a roadside assistance force, patrols most of the major roads in the country. However, patrols are infrequent.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on road laws, see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://transito.gob.gt/legislacion-en-materia-de-transito/\">Guatemala Department of Transport</a> (in Spanish).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"intercity-buses\">Intercity buses</h3>\n\n<p>Guatemala Municipality no longer allows some intercity buses to enter the city centre.
