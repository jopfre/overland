You can apply for a visa, and check the status of your visa application <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.evisa.sy/home-content\">via this website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It currently takes approximately 5-7 days for a visa application to be processed and a decision to be made.

Daesh, formerly known as ISIL/ISIS, continues to carry out regular attacks, especially in north-east Syria.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorism attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreign nationals, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>public transport and transport hubs, such as airports</li>\n  <li>border crossings</li>\n  <li>public squares and other crowded places</li>\n  <li>religious sites and ceremonies, and places of worship</li>\n  <li>hotels, cafes and restaurants</li>\n  <li>commercial venues, including markets and stores</li>\n  <li>residential buildings and compounds</li>\n  <li>sports venues and stadiums</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Attacks could also target:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>military sites, security forces and institutions</li>\n  <li>oil facilities</li>\n  <li>government buildings and embassies</li>\n  <li>political offices and events</li>\n  <li>police stations</li>\n  <li>maritime facilities</li>\n  <li>hospitals, schools and universities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups continue to pose a significant threat to civilians living in Syria and have shown they can carry out co-ordinated attacks against military and security targets, and civilians. Types of attack include shootings, large-scale co-ordinated bombings designed to cause mass casualties, suicide bombs, vehicle bombs, rockets and mortars.</p>\n\n<p>Take particular care during periods of national or religious significance and on public holidays.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"prosecution-in-the-uk\">Prosecution in the UK</h3>\n\n<p>If you travel to Syria to fight, and your activities amount to offences against UK terrorism legislation, you could be prosecuted when you return to the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorist-kidnap\">Terrorist kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There is a very high threat of kidnapping from terrorists throughout Syria. Kidnappings can be for financial or political gain. There have been a number of kidnappings, including of British nationals and other westerners. Some hostages have been killed.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups operating in Syria routinely use kidnapping as a tactic. This includes British nationals who are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release. </p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"security-situation\">Security situation</h2>\n\n<p>The situation in Syria remains volatile and dangerous after over a decade of conflict and insecurity.</p>\n\n<p>Hay’at Tahrir al Sham, formerly known as Jabhat Fatah al Sham and Al Nusrah Front, has taken control of the majority of Syria and are the country’s interim authorities. The former Bashar al-Assad regime has ended.</p>\n\n<p>Fighting and violence may occur around the country and is highly unpredictable. It includes artillery and airstrikes.</p>\n\n<p>Fighting has, at various times, led to the temporary suspension of commercial flights, road closures, and the closure of some border crossings. Major motorways (M4 and M5) may be affected. Curfews may be imposed across the country.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"journalists-in-syria\">Journalists in Syria</h3>\n\n<p>Journalists and other foreigners may be vulnerable to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>mistreatment by armed groups</li>\n  <li>death or injury from abandoned unexploded weapons, improvised explosive devices or bombardment of the area</li>\n  <li>detainment by  armed groups</li>\n  <li>confiscation of phones, cameras and video cameras by security forces</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-activity\">Political activity</h3>\n\n<p>The current political situation in Syria is fast moving. There may be risks to your safety, including detention, if you take part in  political activity in Syria. Under the former Bashar al-Assad regime thousands of people were detained, and in many cases tortured and executed, because of actual or perceived involvement in political activity.</p>\n\n<p>Bashar al-Assad regime authorities detained and deported several British nationals for unauthorised activity. Activity in Syria may continue to  attract attention. If you are deported by local authorities, it is unlikely you will be able to return to Syria.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"basic-services\">Basic services</h3>\n\n<p>There is a humanitarian crisis in Syria. Public infrastructure and services have been seriously affected by the conflict including lack of water, sanitation and health services. Electricity, internet and cellular services are intermittent in many parts of the country. Food supplies are extremely limited and what’s available is often prohibitively expensive. It is often difficult to get or pay for basic goods and services, including food and fuel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sanctions\">Sanctions</h3>\n\n<p>The UK has sanctions in place on Syria. Sanctions started in 2011 as part of an EU initiative. See the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-financial-sanctions-implementation\">Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, HM Treasury</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-sanctions-on-syria\">UK sanctions on Syria</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"regional-escalation\">Regional escalation</h2>\n\n<p>Ongoing hostilities in the region and between Israel and Lebanon could escalate quickly and pose risks for the wider region.</p>\n\n<p>On 1 October, Iran launched around 200 ballistic missiles at Israel. On 26 October Israel carried out military action against Iran.</p>\n\n<p>Monitor this travel advice and other media as the situation is changing fast.

There is an increased threat to westerners in Syria. Foreign nationals are high-value hostages.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"religion\">Religion</h3>\n\n<p>Syria is a multi-faith country. Alongside the majority Sunni population, there are large practising Shia, Christian, Druze and Alawite communities, as well as other smaller sects and religions. As the conflict continues, divisions along sectarian lines have increased. Communities have been displaced and levels of religious tolerance can vary considerably. There are restrictions on unlicensed political and religious activity, particularly political Islam.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You must carry copies of your passport photo page and visa for identification.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-penalties\">Illegal drugs penalties</h3>\n\n<p>There are severe penalties for drug offences in Syria. The penalty for drug possession is life imprisonment, and the death penalty applies for drug trafficking.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"money\">Money</h3>\n\n<p>As a result of the ongoing conflict there are restrictions on financial transactions in Syria. Prices for certain items may be listed in US dollars. The former Bashar al-Assad authorities warned against carrying or using currencies other than the Syrian pound, with severe penalties.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Road travel is very dangerous in many parts of the country due to fighting, the fragile security situation and unexploded weapons.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards and traffic systems are poor, and the accident rate is high. Driving at night is particularly dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>If you are driving a car and are involved in an accident with a pedestrian, it is likely you’ll be held legally responsible.</p>\n\n<p>Road networks may be blocked without warning. There are security force checkpoints on major road routes.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Fighting near airports can cause flights to be suspended. Damascus airport is currently operating with some international flights. Other airports remain closed.</p>\n\n<p>Following the suspension of commercial flights in December, Damascus International Airport has resumed some flights.
