Keep cards in sight when paying in shops and restaurants.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>Azerbaijan is a largely secular society, although most of the population is Muslim.

The usual penalty for smuggling drugs is a fine and a prison sentence of 3 to 7 years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-drones-in-sensitive-locations\">Using cameras and drones in sensitive locations</h3>\n\n<p>Be aware of cultural sensitivities when photographing mosques, churches and other religious sites or sites of commemoration, such as the Alley of Martyrs in Baku. If in doubt, ask for permission.</p>\n\n<p>Military bases, equipment and installations in any condition are considered sensitive areas, and visitors have been detained and questioned while attempting to visit or photograph them.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not have temporary or permanent residence rights in Azerbaijan, you are not allowed to import drones. Any drones will be confiscated by the State Customs Office at the port or border and returned upon departure. </p>\n\n<p>Unmanned drones cannot be rented to individuals without a valid taxpayer identification number (TIN). If you have a TIN, special permission from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mincom.gov.az/en\">Ministry of Digital Development and Transport</a> is required. Manned drones can be rented without requiring permission.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>While same-sex sexual activity is not illegal, LGBT+ people in Azerbaijan tend to keep a low profile.

You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>After one month, you will need an Azerbaijani driving licence issued through the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://asan.gov.az/en\">ASAN Service Offices</a>. You need to carry a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-insurance/driving-abroad\">green card</a> as proof you’re insured to drive in Azerbaijan.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-conditions\">Driving conditions</h3>\n\n<p>Many vehicles are poorly maintained, and the standard of driving is erratic. Accidents are common, mainly due to poor or reckless driving and inconsistent enforcement of traffic rules. Drivers often ignore one-way signs.</p>\n\n<p>Road closures and diversions are often unmarked. Take care when driving at night as many roads are of poor quality and badly lit. Traffic lights that are flashing amber at night mean cars can proceed with caution in either direction.</p>\n\n<p>Drink-driving is a serious offence in in Azerbaijan. If you are tested and found to have any alcohol in your system, you may get a severe fine and possibly a prison sentence. </p>\n\n<p>In the winter months snowfall often causes problems. Pack your vehicle with a blanket, shovel, torch, snacks and old carpet to help if you get stuck in snow.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Try to arrange to be picked up and dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible by a private or company driver, or use a known firm or taxi app.</p>\n\n<p>Some visitors have reported being severely overcharged by local taxis. When using taxis, agree a fare up front, or make sure the taxi meter is switched on. Check that the taxi has working seatbelts.</p>\n\n<p>Ride-hailing apps such as Uber and Bolt are widely available in Azerbaijan.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel-\">Rail travel    </h3>\n\n<p>If you travel by train, secure your valuables, do not leave the compartment unattended, and lock the door from the inside, if your compartment allows.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>There is a risk of earthquakes across the Caucasus region, although there have been no recent serious earthquakes in Azerbaijan.
