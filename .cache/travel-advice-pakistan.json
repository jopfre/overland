Areas of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including Peshawar, suffer regular terrorist attacks. Attacks have also taken place in Karachi and other major cities.</p>\n\n<p>While terrorist attacks are mainly directed against the Pakistani state, attacks could be indiscriminate and occur without warning, including in places visited by foreign nationals, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Pakistani government buildings and infrastructure</li>\n  <li>security, judicial and police force locations</li>\n  <li>places of worship, including churches and religious sites</li>\n  <li>hotels, restaurants and shopping areas</li>\n  <li>schools and educational institutions</li>\n  <li>popular tourist sites or hiking trails</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Be cautious about attending any public event, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>processions, protests, demonstrations and rallies</li>\n  <li>religious gatherings</li>\n  <li>sports and live music events</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Public transport and transport hubs, including airports, are at risk of attack. Avoid using the railway network due to the risk of terrorist attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Take particular care during periods of national or religious significance, including the month of Ramadan, and during election periods. When travelling, always:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>keep a low profile</li>\n  <li>minimise your exposure to areas and events that pose a higher risk</li>\n  <li>vary your routes and timings if you make regular journeys</li>\n  <li>limit movements on Friday afternoons</li>\n  <li>be prepared to change your plans as necessary</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Examples of recent attacks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in November 2024, a suicide attack by Baloch separatists at Quetta railway station killed at least 26 people.</li>\n  <li>in 2023, TTP militants attacked a police station in Karachi killing police officers</li>\n  <li>in 2022, 4 people were killed in a suicide bomb at the University of Karachi targeting Chinese nationals</li>\n  <li>public service and health officials have been attacked while working on health programmes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorist-kidnap\">Terrorist kidnap </h3>\n\n<p>There is a threat of kidnap throughout Pakistan, particularly within the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces. Terrorist groups are unlikely to prioritise the kidnap of westerners in Pakistan. Any kidnap of a foreign national by terrorist groups in Pakistan would likely be opportunistic.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.  </p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government policy is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Political rallies, protests and demonstrations may take place across the country and can start with little warning. Most are peaceful, but they can turn violent quickly and lead to clashes with law enforcement. During elections, terrorists have targeted security forces, political events, rallies, government buildings and polling stations.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid all political demonstrations, large crowds of people and public events  </li>\n  <li>be prepared to change your plans as necessary </li>\n  <li>keep track of the local news </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>During times of protest or civil unrest, mobile data coverage and internet connectivity may be cut without warning. Additionally, major road networks in and around cities may be shut or blocked. You should have alternative travel options such as different routes for any journeys you plan.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime </h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-yourself-and-your-belongings\">Protecting yourself and your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Street crime is a risk, particularly in crowded areas. Take sensible measures to guard your possessions and reduce your personal risk. Be cautious when moving around urban areas at night, especially when on foot.</p>\n\n<p>There is an active black market in forged and stolen passports. Credit card fraud is common. Beware of scams.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"criminal-kidnap\">Criminal kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>British nationals of Pakistani origin have been targeted by criminals, including kidnappers, as they are often perceived as being wealthier than locals.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences  </h2>\n\n<p>Pakistan is a Muslim country. Respect the local traditions, customs and laws. Make sure your actions do not cause offence. </p>\n\n<p>Standards of public behaviour differ between the UK and Pakistan. Behaviour that might be acceptable in the UK can cause offence in Pakistan. Being considerate of others is important in Pakistani culture.

This is not rigorously enforced, but consider telling local authorities about any travel plans. There are a number of prohibited areas across the country. Officials could stop you and ask you to turn back.</p>\n\n<p>When travelling in Pakistan be aware of the risks, including carjacking. You or your travel company should contact the local authorities of your destination in advance to check the local security situation. They may arrange police protection. They will also tell you if you need a No Objection Certificate from the Pakistani Ministry of Interior.</p>\n\n<p>Take safety precautions, keep a low profile and choose your accommodation carefully.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel </h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Pakistan, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll need to have both the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 version of the international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> and your UK driving licence with you in the car.

Road conditions can be poor. Local driving standards are erratic, especially at night. Take care on long road journeys and when travelling cross-country. </p>\n\n<p>The north of Pakistan is mountainous. Many roads, including the N15 highway between Chilas and Babusar in Gilgit Baltistan, are inaccessible at some times of the year due to extreme weather conditions. Many roads in these remote areas are of very poor quality with uneven surfaces. Landslides frequently block or destroy roads. Use experienced local drivers when travelling these routes and only in clear weather conditions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-transport\">Public transport</h3>\n\n<p>Due to the level of crime, avoid using public transport, including the Metro Bus between Rawalpindi and Islamabad.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis </h3>\n\n<p>Avoid using street or e-taxis.

Although there is a ceasefire in place, there are significant tensions between India and Pakistan. There is a serious risk of small arms fire and occasional mortar fire.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have the necessary permissions to travel.

Check with your airline or travel agent.</p>\n\n<p>Road routes are also likely to be restricted by seasonal weather, with the Babusar Pass liable to close due to snowfall.</p>\n\n<p>The terrain in Gilgit-Baltistan is mountainous, with remote and isolated locations that are difficult to police. You are strongly advised to get local security advice and make appropriate personal security arrangements before you visit.</p>\n\n<p>All foreign nationals must register with the local authorities when visiting Gilgit-Baltistan. You might need a permit for mountaineering or trekking, particularly for mountains over 6,000 metres. The permission process can take up to 2 months and is best organised through a travel company. The validity of your travel insurance policy may be affected if you do not have the correct permits.</p>\n\n<p>Use reputable trekking agencies, stay on established routes, and always walk in groups.

The safety of daily activity can be unpredictable. Criminal and political violence is common, including armed carjacking, robbery, kidnap and murder. Strikes called by religious and political parties can cause significant disruption and sometimes lead to violent civil unrest. Smaller-scale labour strikes are also common and cause regular disruptions locally.</p>\n\n<p>There is a risk of violence in parts of the city which include government offices. Major hotels and the financial district are generally seen as more stable, though there remains a risk of violence, particularly after Friday prayers. See the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/pakistan/safety-and-security#terrorism\">Terrorism section</a> for more information on terror threats.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>plan any travel in the city carefully</li>\n  <li>take advice from hosts or trusted contacts, follow instructions from law enforcement officers and be prepared to cancel or cut back your plans</li>\n  <li>be especially vigilant in Lyari, Malir, Quaidabad and Orangi Town – they have a greater risk of violence based on past activity</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"lahore\">Lahore</h2>\n\n<p>Lahore is the capital of Punjab and attracts large numbers of tourists and business travellers.
