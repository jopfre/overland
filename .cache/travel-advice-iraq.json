This includes parts of the provinces of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Anbar</li>\n  <li>Baghdad</li>\n  <li>Diyala</li>\n  <li>Ninewah</li>\n  <li>Salah Al-Din</li>\n  <li>Tam’mim (Kirkuk)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals are high-value targets for terrorists, insurgents and criminals. Indiscriminate attacks against public places and Iraqi civilians also occur. Terrorist attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visiting by foreign nationals, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>airports and public transport</li>\n  <li>land border crossings</li>\n  <li>markets, stores, hotels and restaurants</li>\n  <li>government buildings, political offices, police stations and military establishments</li>\n  <li>residential compounds</li>\n  <li>maritime facilities and oil facilities</li>\n  <li>religious sites and ceremonies</li>\n  <li>political events, large crowds</li>\n  <li>sports venues and stadiums</li>\n  <li>fake vehicle checkpoints</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is a heightened threat of attacks against western interests. While attacks can take place at any time, there’s a heightened threat during religious or public holidays. Militant groups opposed to a western presence pose a threat to UK and other interests in Iraq, including the Kurdistan Region.</p>\n\n<p>Methods of attack have included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>large-scale co-ordinated bombings designed to cause mass casualties</li>\n  <li>rockets and mortars</li>\n  <li>shootings</li>\n  <li>suicide bombs</li>\n  <li>vehicle bombs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"uk-prosecution-for-terrorism-offences\">UK prosecution for terrorism offences</h3>\n\n<p>If you travel to Iraq to fight, and your activities amount to offences against UK terrorism legislation, you could be prosecuted on your return to the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorist-kidnap\">Terrorist kidnap</h3>\n\n<div role=\"note\" aria-label=\"Warning\" class=\"application-notice help-notice\">\n<p>There is a high threat of kidnapping throughout Iraq.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>This includes both from Daesh and other terrorist and militant groups. Keep your security arrangements up-to-date and carefully plan any travel plans. Kidnappings can be for ideological reasons as well as financial or political gain.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conflict-affecting-lebanon\">Conflict affecting Lebanon</h2>\n\n<p>Ongoing hostilities between Israel and Lebanon could escalate quickly and pose risks for the wider region.</p>\n\n<p>On 1 October, Iran launched over 200 ballistic missiles at Israel. Further attacks cannot be ruled out. Israel has promised a response.</p>\n\n<p>Monitor this travel advice and other media as the situation is changing afast.

Coalition military installations continue to be a target, including in the Kurdistan Region.</p>\n\n<p>The threat level may restrict UK government staff from travelling to certain areas.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re travelling to Iraq, take security precautions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>get advice from a private security company</li>\n  <li>make arrangements for secure accommodation and transport</li>\n  <li>have contingency plans in place</li>\n  <li>stay up to date with local media</li>\n  <li>consider pre-deployment training</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The security situation may change at short notice. You may need to ‘shelter in place’ or hunker down for several days. Keep essential supplies, such as food, water and medicine where you are staying.</p>\n\n<p>Anti-British and anti-American sentiment can increase during political tension or because of long-running hostility from some Iraqi militias towards the Global Coalition Against Daesh. Protests or attacks may be directed towards British and American institutes or companies, or those which appear to be connected to Britain or the United States of America. Monitor local media to keep up to date with developments.</p>\n\n<p>In the event of widespread disturbances or a deterioration in the security situation, there may be limits to the help that <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> can provide. Read further information and advice on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-deal-with-a-crisis-overseas\">how to deal with a crisis overseas</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Ensure your travel documents are up to date in case you need to leave Iraq at short notice. Do not rely on <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> being able to help you evacuate in an emergency.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protests\">Protests</h3>\n\n<p>Protests take place regularly across Iraq, including in and around the International Zone. Clashes between Iraqi security forces and protesters have resulted in casualties and loss of life. Avoid rallies, marches and processions, and follow the instructions of local authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"curfews\">Curfews</h3>\n\n<p>Curfews and vehicle bans can be imposed at short notice, particularly during protests and civil unrest, but also around religious holidays, pilgrimages and politically sensitive times, such as elections.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime </h2>\n\n<p>The proliferation of guns throughout Iraq mean they are readily available to many Iraqi citizens. Guns are frequently used to settle personal grievances, criminal acts and tribal disputes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>It is a legal requirement to carry some form of photographic ID in Iraq. Always carry your passport or residence permit. The authorities may stop people for ID checks at checkpoints within cities and on main roads across the country. You should cooperate with officials conducting checks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lost-and-stolen-passports\">Lost and stolen passports</h3>\n\n<p>It is a legal requirement to publish the details of your lost or stolen passport in two local newspapers, after reporting the incident to the police. You may be refused an exit stamp until you have done so.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. During this time, do not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in your car</li>\n  <li>play loud music or dance</li>\n  <li>swear in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<p>You should also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes – clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n  <li>be aware that fasting can cause tiredness, particularly during the later afternoon and early evening</li>\n  <li>be patient and show tolerance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-arba-een\">The Arba’-een</h3>\n\n<p>The Arba’-een, an annual pilgrimage that attracts millions of pilgrims to Iraq, usually occurs between August and September.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel to Iraq during the pilgrimage, ensure that your belongings are secure at all times. Keep copies of your passports, visas and other important documents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"child-custody\">Child custody</h3>\n\n<p>Iraqi family law is very different from UK law. Male heads of household can impose ‘travel bans’ on family members. Even if you, or your child, hold a British passport, you may be subject to Iraqi laws.</p>\n\n<p>If you are leaving Iraq with a child that has an Iraqi or dual-national Iraqi father you may need to show proof of parental permission to travel. This applies even if their mother is with them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"journalists\">Journalists</h3>\n\n<p>Authorities may detain journalists using allegations of inadequate paperwork. Journalists should be extremely cautious and take adequate security measures.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>The import, manufacture, or selling of alcoholic drinks is punishable by fines of up to 25 million Iraqi dinars (IQD). <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> is not aware of any instances of Iraqi officials stopping travellers carrying alcohol for personal use.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Iraq continues to practise the death penalty for a range of crimes including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>drug trafficking</li>\n  <li>espionage</li>\n  <li>kidnapping</li>\n  <li>murder</li>\n  <li>rape</li>\n  <li>smuggling antiquities</li>\n  <li>terrorism</li>\n  <li>war crimes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>In July 2024, the Iraqi Parliament updated its Anti-Prostitution and Homosexuality Law which criminalises same-sex relationships, any promotion of same-sex relationships or behaviours, and bans people from changing gender. Under the amendment, same-sex relationships are now illegal and sexual acts could lead to a prison sentence between 10 to 15 years. If the Iraqi authorities consider your actions, clothing or other items to promote LGBT+ identities or prostitution,  you could be imprisoned for up to seven years and fined between 10 to 15 million Iraqi dinars.  </p>\n\n<p>Under the new law, it is illegal to have or perform gender changing surgery, unless you have approval from the courts. You could be imprisoned for up to three years.</p>\n\n<p>There is an increased risk of violence and threats (such as blackmail and intimidation) against anyone being thought to be part of the LGBT+ community or supporting their rights. There have been attacks against the LGBT+ community and its supporters.  </p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Iraq, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll need to have both the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 version of the international driving permit (<abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Road travel within Iraq is dangerous. Driving standards are low compared to those in the UK. Road traffic accidents are frequent and often result in fatalities. Fake vehicle checkpoints have been used to launch terrorist attacks. There is also a risk of carjacking and robbery.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>When in an airport, be wary of anyone approaching you that you do not know or cannot identify. Do not accept offers from strangers for help or transport. Cooperate fully with security officials at airports and observe any additional security measures.</p>\n\n<p>Your transfer vehicle should be pre-arranged or provided by a trusted sponsor.</p>\n\n<p>Since October 2023, drone and rocket attacks have hit Coalition military installations across Iraq. Erbil International Airport has had short closures, with operations resuming after a few hours. Indirect rocket attacks have occurred against Baghdad International Airport and Erbil Airport.</p>\n\n<p>Flight schedules may change without notice. Contact your airline or travel company for the latest information before travelling. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List (ASL)</a> lists all known airlines in Iraq that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>UK government staff working in Iraq are authorised to use aircraft operated by Iraqi Airways for internal flights on a case by case basis.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Ports are at high risk of attack. Be extremely cautious if you are in any type of vessel in the northern Persian Gulf. Vessels are at an increased risk of attack in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the Gulf of Oman</li>\n  <li>Northern Arabian Sea</li>\n  <li>Gulf of Aden</li>\n  <li>Bab El Mandeb</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Consider any regional tensions that may affect your route and check whether sea borders will be open before your crossing.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>Flash floods are common between November and March.
