It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities in Israel and the <abbr title=\"Occupied Palestinian Territories\">OPTs</abbr> set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://embassies.gov.il/london/Pages/default.aspx\">Israeli Embassy in London</a> or the  <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://palmissionuk.org/consular-affairs-ar/\">Palestinian Mission to the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Check Israeli immigration policies before you travel. Allow extra time for increased security measures and checks at airports, especially during Israeli holidays and during the summer tourist season.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passport-validity-requirements\">Passport validity requirements</h2>\n\n<p>To enter Israel or the <abbr title=\"Occupied Palestinian Territories\">OPTs</abbr>, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’  at least 6 months after the date you arrive.</p>\n\n<p>Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew\">Renew your passport</a> if you need to.</p>\n\n<p>You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"visa-requirements\">Visa requirements</h2>\n\n<p>You can visit Israel without a visa as a tourist. On entry, visitors get permission to stay for up to 3 months. However, if you are a dual national, read the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/israel/entry-requirements#british-people-holding-dual-nationality\">dual nationals guidance</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<p>If you work in Israel without the proper permissions, you can be detained and deported. This process could take several months.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"electronic-travel-authorisation-eta\">Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA)</h2>\n\n<p>From 1 January 2025, to visit Israel you will need to get an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) before you arrive. The ETA covers a visit of 90 days and will cost 25 new Israeli sheqels. You can check your eligibility and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://israel-entry.piba.gov.il/\">apply for an ETA with the Israel Population and Immigration authority</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"checks-at-border-control\"> Checks at border control</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"passport-stamping-and-entry-cards\">Passport stamping and entry cards</h3>\n\n<p>Visitors entering via Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport get an entry card instead of an entry stamp in their passport. At other entry points to the country, you may get an entry card or you may get a stamp.</p>\n\n<p>Keep your entry card with your passport until you leave. This is evidence that you entered Israel legally. You may need it, particularly if you’re crossing into the <abbr title=\"Occupied Palestinian Territories\">OPTs</abbr>. If you’re refused entry to Israel, your passport may be stamped with an entry stamp and 2 red lines drawn across it to show the refusal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"stamps-with-restrictions\">Stamps with restrictions</h3>\n\n<p>Entry stamps that state ‘Palestinian Authority only’ or ‘Judea and Samaria only’ have been issued to some travellers at:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the Allenby Bridge crossing with Jordan</li>\n  <li>Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since travellers entering by the Allenby Bridge crossing must pass through Israeli checkpoints and Israeli-controlled territory to reach Jerusalem or Gaza, this effectively limits travellers who receive this stamp.</p>\n\n<p>It is not clear how travellers who get this stamp at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport can leave the airport without violating the restriction.</p>\n\n<p>This stamp has been issued to travellers who have no Palestinian or other Arab ancestry, and do not seem to have a claim to a Palestinian Authority ID.     </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"immigration-checks\">Immigration checks</h3>\n\n<p>The Israeli authorities decide if you can enter Israel. You may experience lengthy personal questioning and baggage searches at security when you enter and leave Israel. Some visitors may face searches and questioning, including those:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>with Palestinian or Arab ancestry</li>\n  <li>with evidence of previous travel which may be considered suspicious</li>\n  <li>who are considered to have publicly criticised the state of Israel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals can legally be refused entry if they:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>have publicly called for a boycott of Israel or Israeli settlements</li>\n  <li>belong to an organisation which has called for a boycott</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Travellers may occasionally be held at border control for more checks. This is not routine, but some travellers experience delays, sometimes for several hours. Israeli security has sometimes requested access to travellers’ personal email or social media accounts as a condition of entry.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previous-travel-to-countries-in-the-region\">Previous travel to countries in the region</h3>\n\n<p>Evidence of previous travel to another country in the region, such as entry or exit stamps in your passport, does not normally stop you entering Israel. However, you may face extra questioning at the border.</p>\n\n<p>If you have concerns about visas or entry into Israel, including whether previous travel can affect you travelling there, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://embassies.gov.il/london/Pages/default.aspx\">Israeli Embassy in the UK</a> before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"refusal-of-entry-into-israel\">Refusal of entry into Israel</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re refused entry to Israel, you will be booked on the next available flight back to where you flew in from, on the same airline.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on the flight schedule, you may be taken to the Immigration Detention Centre (a few minutes’ drive from the airport) to wait until your flight departs. You will have access to a telephone, information in English and medical assistance if needed. Your luggage will stay at the airport, so tell officials if you need to retrieve anything urgent from your luggage, for example medication.</p>\n\n<p>You can contact the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-tel-aviv\">British Embassy in Israel</a> from the detention centre. They can help where possible but cannot intervene in immigration decisions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"entering-the-opts\">Entering the <abbr title=\"Occupied Palestinian Territories\">OPTs</abbr>\n</h2>\n\n<p>The Israeli authorities control entry to the <abbr title=\"Occupied Palestinian Territories\">OPTs</abbr>, including by sea to Gaza. You must show a passport and Israeli immigration slip to cross between Israel and the <abbr title=\"Occupied Palestinian Territories\">OPTs</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>Read about the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.gov.il/en/departments/policies/judeaentry2022\">requirements for foreign nationals entering the West Bank on the Israeli government website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Israeli border officials at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport have asked some travellers to sign a form stating they are not allowed to enter territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority unless they get advance authorisation from the Israeli ‘Territory Actions Co-ordinator’. You can be deported from Israel and barred from entry for up to 10 years for violating this restriction.</p>\n\n<p>If immigration officials believe you plan to enter Gaza without permission, or that you’re entering Israel to work in the <abbr title=\"Occupied Palestinian Territories\">OPTs</abbr>, they may refuse your entry.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot support your application for entry or exit permits for Gaza. If you decide to visit Gaza against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advice, you must contact the relevant authorities well in advance. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot provide administrative support to UK charities wishing to enter Gaza by the Rafah crossing.</p>\n\n<p>The Rafah border regularly closes with no warning and for long periods. The Erez border is currently closed. At these times it may be impossible to enter or leave Gaza. </p>\n\n<p>Israeli checkpoints may close on Israeli public holidays and during periods of increased instability. There is <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.accesscoordination.org/\">information on known checkpoint closures on the UN website</a>. This can change at short notice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"british-nationals-of-palestinian-origin\">British nationals of Palestinian origin</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re a British national of Palestinian origin (on the Palestinian Population Register or holding a Palestinian ID number), you must have a Palestinian passport or travel document to leave Gaza or the West Bank.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a British national with a Palestinian name or place of birth but without a Palestinian ID number, you may face problems. British nationals of Palestinian origin or British nationals married to Palestinians have been refused entry into Israel.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"british-people-holding-dual-nationality\">British people holding dual nationality </h2>\n\n<p>British-Palestinian dual nationals living in the West Bank and Gaza may only exit the <abbr title=\"Occupied Palestinian Territories\">OPTs</abbr> through the Allenby border crossing into Jordan or the Rafah border crossing into Egypt. They must return by the same route. If you’re a British-Palestinian dual national entering Gaza against <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> travel advice, check entry and exit procedures with the relevant authorities. There is a limit on the number of dual nationals permitted to enter and exit Gaza through Erez – this includes if you are entering for medical or humanitarian reasons. The Israeli government has the authority to make decisions on entry and exit permits through Erez.</p>\n\n<p>Check with your nearest Israeli embassy if you need pre-approval to travel to Israel. Dual nationals holding Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian and Lebanese citizenship have previously been affected. If you are not a citizen of any of these countries, but have close family ties, you should check with your nearest Israeli embassy before travel.</p>\n\n<p>Children with at least one Israeli parent (father or mother) are considered Israeli nationals.

Hamas continues to launch rockets into Israel and the Israeli Defence Forces are conducting significant military activity in Gaza.   </p>\n\n<p>Terrorist attacks in Israel and the <abbr title=\"Occupied Palestinian Territories\">OPTs</abbr> are very likely to continue with an increased threat of attacks, including by individuals acting alone.</p>\n\n<p>Any attacks could be indiscriminate, including places visited by foreign nationals such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the Old City in Jerusalem</li>\n  <li>government, military and police installations</li>\n  <li>security personnel including military and police</li>\n  <li>transport networks</li>\n  <li>businesses with western interests</li>\n  <li>crowded places</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Areas where foreign nationals and tourists are known to gather may be at higher risk of attack. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of recent significant attacks include:</p>\n\n<p>In 2024:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>7 people were killed in a shooting and stabbing attack in Jaffa</li>\n  <li>3 people were killed in a shooting attack at the Allenby Bridge Crossing</li>\n  <li>one person was killed and 17 injured during a ramming attack in Ra’anana</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In 2023:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>2 people were killed and one injured during a shooting attack in the Jordan Valley</li>\n  <li>one person was killed and 6 people injured during a car-ramming incident in Tel Aviv</li>\n  <li>one person was killed and 3 people injured in a shooting attack in Tel Aviv</li>\n  <li>7 people were killed and 3 injured during a shooting attack in Neve Yaakov, East Jerusalem</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorist-kidnap\">Terrorist kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>Terrorist kidnap is a risk in Gaza and along the border with Egypt. There is a large-scale conflict happening in areas of southern Israel close to the border with Gaza and Hamas has taken hundreds of hostages, including British nationals, across the border and into Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release. </p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is to not make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>There is currently a large-scale conflict happening in areas of southern Israel close to the border with Gaza.

Check locations of ultra-Orthodox neighbourhoods and towns in travel guides.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country.

This includes age and gender-based entry restrictions, and routine physical searches. There will be a heightened security environment and tense atmosphere during Ramadan in the Old City.</p>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<p>You should also: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes – clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n  <li>be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk or be aware that fasting can cause tiredness, particularly during the later afternoon and early evening</li>\n  <li>be patient and show tolerance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"buying-property\">Buying property</h3>\n\n<p>There are risks in buying property in Israeli settlements on land considered to be occupied under international law in East Jerusalem, the rest of the West Bank and the Golan.

Do not take photographs of military or police officers or installations.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Israeli law does not criminalise same-sex sexual relations between consenting adults. In the <abbr title=\"Occupied Palestinian Territories\">OPTs</abbr>, same-sex sexual activity is legal in the West Bank but illegal in Gaza, where it carries a 10-year prison sentence.</p>\n\n<p>Attitudes towards LGBT+ issues in some parts of Palestinian and Israeli society can be hostile.</p>\n\n<p>In more conservative Israeli areas in the West Bank, including in ultra-Orthodox communities, if you show affection in public, regardless of your gender or sexuality, you may receive negative attention.</p>\n\n<p>In Palestinian society, same-sex relationships are largely taboo. Some Palestinian groups may violently oppose cultural events and demonstrations, which they see as inconsistent with their values. This includes those seen as linked to the LGBT+ community, even if the event is not intended to promote LGBT+ rights. In these cases, the Palestinian security forces and police may not always act effectively to protect participants. Be aware of these risks. Liaise with local authorities before planning or organising any event.</p>\n\n<p>Tel Aviv has a large, active LGBT+ community and a big annual Pride parade. Jerusalem also has an annual Pride parade, but there has been a heavy security presence at the event since a fatal stabbing in 2015.

While women aged 51 or over and men aged 56 or over with special permits have been granted entry for prayers, many potential worshippers have been turned away. Additionally, there have been routine instances of physical searches and detentions.</p>\n\n<p>Street protests and demonstrations can happen across Jerusalem, including East Jerusalem and the Old City. Check local news ahead of travel and follow instructions of local authorities. Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>There are frequent demonstrations in many of the areas visited by tourists in the Old City and after Friday prayers.

Be aware of your surroundings at all times and leave the area if there is evidence of tension or unrest, for example if the shops in the souks of the Old City suddenly begin to close their shutters. The entrances to the Old City may have additional checks, or may close.</p>\n\n<p>There have been a number of violent incidents on public transport and near public transport lines. Take extra care when using public transport in Jerusalem. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"tel-aviv\">Tel Aviv</h2>\n\n<p>Take extra care when using public transport in Tel Aviv, in particular at transport hubs, and when using buses in the greater Tel Aviv area.

If you travel to Gaza against our advice, review your security arrangements regularly.</p>\n\n<p>The border crossings with Israel (Erez) and Egypt (Rafah) may close with no notice. Check the status of the Rafah crossing into Egypt before you travel. Movement to the Rafah crossing and beyond is at your own risk. Currently, the Rafah border regularly closes with no warning and for long periods. The Erez border has been closed since 7 October 2023.</p>\n\n<p>There will be no warning siren inside Gaza and there are no official air raid shelters. Take advice from locals about the safest place to shelter.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> cannot help individuals applying for entry or exit permits for Gaza. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories/entry-requirements\">entry requirements</a>.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> recognises that major international organisations need to carry out humanitarian and reconstruction work and engage in independent reporting and verification of the situation in Gaza. Medical and other essential specialist staff should co-ordinate their entry to and exit from Gaza with those organisations.</p>\n\n<p>Do not enter Gaza by sea, including via a flotilla delivering humanitarian aid. The Israeli Navy routinely patrols the area and will prevent any vessels attempting to breach the restrictions – see <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories/entry-requirements\">entry requirements</a>. You will be detained and deported, and your electronic equipment is likely to be confiscated. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> does not believe that humanitarian supplies should be delivered in this way. If you send humanitarian assistance or other goods to Gaza, use established channels.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"israel-lebanon\">Israel-Lebanon</h2>\n\n<p>There was an ongoing conflict between Israel and Lebanese Hizballah (LH).

There are continued tensions between Israel and Lebanon.</p>\n\n<p>There remains a risk that hostilities could reignite, and with little warning. You should check Home Front Command for the latest guidance. Restrictions may be put in place at short notice. If travelling near military operation areas, follow all Israeli official instructions.</p>\n\n<p>Military activity continues on the Israel-Lebanon border.

Rocket attacks and sporadic gunfire occur without warning. There is also a risk of falling debris from Israeli and Syrian air defence systems.</p>\n\n<p>Landmines have been planted across the Occupied Golan Heights, including near to populated areas and roads. These areas are usually marked and often fenced off. Follow established roads and paths. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> long-standing advice has been to not hike off-trail. If you’re in the region, follow advice from local law enforcement.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"border-with-egypt\">Border with Egypt</h2>\n\n<p>The security situation on the border with Egypt is volatile. Take extra care when using the Route 10 road, which runs along the Israeli border with Egypt. Route 10 is sometimes closed by the Israeli authorities. Consider using other routes.</p>\n\n<p>There are frequent clashes between Israeli Security Forces and Palestinians in these areas and violent incidents can occur without warning.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"west-bank\">West Bank</h2>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> advises against all travel to Tulkuram, Jenin and Tubas and all but essential travel to the rest of the West Bank, except for East Jerusalem.</p>\n\n<p>There has been a heightened state of tension and violent clashes resulting in deaths in the West Bank since the outbreak of conflict in October 2023.</p>\n\n<p>Expect road closures and numerous checkpoints across the West Bank.</p>\n\n<p>There are no warning sirens or official air raid shelters inside the West Bank, outside of Israeli settlements.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot travel into or out of the West Bank without passing through at least one Israeli military checkpoint. You need a passport and immigration slip to go through these checkpoints. Checkpoints may be closed during Jewish high holidays, Israeli public holidays and periods of increased instability restricting movement in and out of the West Bank. This does not normally affect foreign nationals, but would affect British-Palestinian dual nationals. Road closures can occur with little notice. Keep up to date with local travel advice through local media, and international information outlets like the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.accesscoordination.org/\">UN’s Access Coordination Unit</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The cities of Bethlehem, Ramallah and Jericho see large numbers of tourists including on organised tours, although tourist numbers have reduced since 7 October 2023. While there have been no recent reports of any serious incidents involving foreigners, you should take care when travelling anywhere in the West Bank.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-incidents\">Violent incidents</h3>\n\n<p>There is a risk of violent incidents and demonstrations in the West Bank (see <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/the-occupied-palestinian-territories/safety-and-security\">Political situation</a> for details).
