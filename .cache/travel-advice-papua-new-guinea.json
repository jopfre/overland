Criminals often use machetes (‘bush knives’) and firearms in assaults and thefts. They target people who are using banks and ATMs.</p>\n\n<p>Walking after dark is particularly dangerous in Port Moresby and other urban centres.</p>\n\n<p>You can take precautions such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>not displaying valuables like laptops, cameras and mobile phones</li>\n  <li>not wearing expensive-looking jewellery</li>\n  <li>carrying only small amounts of cash – avoid withdrawing a lot of money, particularly at night</li>\n  <li>keeping valuables secure (for example, in a hotel safe)</li>\n  <li>not travelling alone or at night</li>\n  <li>monitoring the media for possible new security risks</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"vehicle-crime\">Vehicle crime</h3>\n\n<p>Carjacking and other types of vehicle crime are common. Criminals use roadblocks outside towns to stop and loot vehicles and then attack the occupants.</p>\n\n<p>If you plan travel in these areas, particularly after dark, take great care and consider travelling in convoy or using a security escort. Always lock car doors and keep windows up.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-buses-and-taxis\">Public buses and taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Armed criminals have attacked and robbed passengers on public buses (known as ‘PMVs’) and in taxis. There have also been incidents of rape on Port Moresby PMVs. Many PMVs and taxis are not roadworthy.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rape-and-sexual-assault\">Rape and sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Rape and sexual assault are common in Papua New Guinea.
