Attacks could be indiscriminate. Targets might include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Egyptian security forces</li>\n  <li>religious sites</li>\n  <li>large public gatherings</li>\n  <li>places visited by foreign nationals</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The authorities in Egypt have a significant security presence across the country, including armed security officers at important sites, critical infrastructure and road checkpoints. Extra measures are in place at tourist sites.</p>\n\n<p>Recent attacks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in 2022, an attack to the west of the Suez Canal targeting security forces within the city of Ismailiyah</li>\n  <li>in 2019, at least 20 people killed by a car bomb in Central Cairo’s Manial district</li>\n  <li>in 2019, at least 16 people injured after an <abbr title=\"improvised explosive device\">IED</abbr> attack on a tourist bus near the Giza pyramids</li>\n  <li>in 2019, 3 security personnel killed by a suicide bomber in Central Cairo’s Darb al-ahmar district</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are frequent terrorist attacks in North Sinai. Most attacks are in the north-east corner of the governorate between Al-Arish city and the border with Gaza. Most attacks in North Sinai are against the Egyptian government and military installations and personnel. However, terrorists have attacked civilians suspected of working with the authorities and local religious minority groups.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorism-during-holiday-periods\">Terrorism during holiday periods</h3>\n\n<p>There is a heightened threat of terrorism in and around religious sites and during religious festivals, such as the month of Ramadan and the Christmas period (including Coptic Christmas in January). Terrorists have attacked over local holiday weekends. The Egyptian Presidency website has a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.presidency.eg/en/%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9/\">list of public holidays</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Follow the advice of Egyptian authorities and be vigilant in crowds and large gatherings.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"regional-escalation\">Regional escalation</h2>\n\n<p>Ongoing hostilities in the region and between Israel and Lebanon could escalate quickly and pose risks for the wider region.</p>\n\n<p>On 1 October, Iran launched around 200 ballistic missiles at Israel.

Security forces have responded violently to protests and disturbances, resulting in a number of deaths.</p>\n\n<p>Protests, marches and demonstrations could happen across Egypt, particularly after Friday prayers. They are more common in cities and could happen at short notice. Avoid large gatherings, demonstrations and protests as the situation could change quickly and without warning. Police have used water cannons, tear gas, birdshot and live ammunition as crowd control. The authorities may close public spaces, including parks and beaches, at short notice, particularly around holidays. If you do not follow their instructions, you could be fined or arrested.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals involved in any political activity or activities critical of the government may be at risk of detention or other measures.</p>\n\n<p>There are reports that security personnel are checking personal electronic devices, particularly around public gathering places, such as Tahrir Square.  </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Take extra care when travelling alone, particularly at night, in taxis and microbuses. The crime rate is generally low, but visitors have reported:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>armed robberies</li>\n  <li>muggings, including in taxis</li>\n  <li>sexual assaults</li>\n  <li>break-ins to accommodation and cars</li>\n  <li>pickpocketing and bag-snatching</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To report a crime, phone the tourist police on 126. If you do not report a crime before you leave Egypt, it will be difficult to prosecute later.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault-and-harassment\">Sexual assault and harassment</h3>\n\n<p>A number of sexual assaults have been reported to the British Embassy, including cases involving minors.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of cases that have been reported took place in tourist resorts in the Red Sea region, often committed by someone the victim had already met, including hotel workers and excursion staff. There have also been reports of hotel staff discouraging incidents being reported to local police. </p>\n\n<p>Female travellers should exercise caution when travelling alone, particularly at night, in buses, taxis and microbuses. If you are travelling on public transport including microbuses, avoid being the last passenger left on board.</p>\n\n<p>Take extra precautions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>make sure children and young people are always accompanied by known and trusted people and not left alone with hotel or excursion staff</li>\n  <li>do not allow hotel staff to enter your room when you are alone – try to ensure a friend or relative is present</li>\n  <li>avoid travelling in a taxi alone – if this is not possible, apply extra security by sharing the details of your driver and trip with a friend, and using live location on WhatsApp</li>\n  <li>use reputable providers for any services and excursions, and carry out research beforehand, including by consulting your tour operator where you have one</li>\n  <li>avoid sharing personal contact or social media details</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">advice for women travelling abroad</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/victim-of-rape-and-sexual-assault-abroad\">information for British nationals affected by rape or sexual assault abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you experience sexual harassment or assault, or if you feel threatened or unsafe, report it to the hotel or local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Tourist police: 126</p>\n\n<p>Local police: 122</p>\n\n<p>British Embassy in Cairo: +20 2 279 1 6000</p>\n\n<p>All numbers provide English speakers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Take particular care of your possessions on buses, trains and in crowds. Criminals may ride past on bikes and snatch valuables.</p>\n\n<p>Keep a copy of your passport, visa and flight ticket separately from originals when travelling. Leave copies at home where others can access them and store them electronically so you can access them easily. If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the police immediately and get a police report. You will need a police report to get visa stamps transferred to your replacement passport.     </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scammers-and-touts-at-tourist-sites\">Scammers and touts at tourist sites</h3>\n\n<p>Be cautious in tourist areas, where scammers and touts target foreign nationals.</p>\n\n<p>Touts may confront tourists at popular tourist sites, such as the Giza pyramids, and aggressively ask for money or business. This can even happen when you’re in a car or taxi. If you use a pre-booked guide or take an organised tour to visit the pyramids, you are likely to face fewer difficulties. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>Egypt is predominantly an Islamic country. Always respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Make sure you do not cause offence, especially during Ramadan or when you visit religious areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"religion\">Religion</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to encourage people to convert to Christianity.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. Ramadan in Egypt in 2025 will likely begin 28 February or 1 March and last for 30 days. Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<p>You should also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes – clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n  <li>be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk</li>\n  <li>be patient and show tolerance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Police check ID regularly and will ask to see your passport. They may detain you if you cannot show it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code\">Dress code</h3>\n\n<p>Dress modestly, especially in rural areas, mosques and souqs (markets).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"behaviour-in-public\">Behaviour in public</h3>\n\n<p>Showing affection in public is frowned upon. Holding hands is generally fine, but there are places in Egypt where this is looked down on. Behaviour accepted in tourist resort areas may not be tolerated elsewhere.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws\">Alcohol laws</h3>\n\n<p>Drinking alcohol anywhere other than a licensed restaurant or bar is illegal and can lead to arrest.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-penalties\">Illegal drugs penalties</h3>\n\n<p>Possession, use or trafficking of illegal drugs is a serious offence and can, even for small amounts, lead to life imprisonment or the death penalty. People who get a life sentence on drugs charges normally spend the rest of their lives in prison with no chance of parole or a pardon.</p>\n\n<p>Khat is illegal in Egypt.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"criticising-the-egyptian-government\">Criticising the Egyptian government</h3>\n\n<p>Making political or negative comments about the Egyptian government, including about the President or security forces, can cause trouble with the authorities. People have faced prison sentences for making insulting comments on social media.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"photography-and-filming-restrictions\">Photography and filming restrictions</h3>\n\n<p>You must get a permit to enter Egypt with professional photography or film equipment. This includes photography umbrellas, artificial outdoor lighting gear and any equipment that occupies or blocks public roads.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to take or share photos that could be considered damaging to the country’s image.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://egymonuments.gov.eg/en/news/egyptian-government-decided-to-allow-egyptians-and-tourists-to-take-photographs-for-free/\">Ministry of Tourism regulations</a> on photography say that you must get an Egyptian citizen’s written permission before you take their photo. Taking pictures of children is prohibited. Do not photograph officials without their consent.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to take photos of, or near, military property. This includes the Suez Canal.</p>\n\n<p>The police have arrested British nationals for photographing churches, electricity stations, train stations and bridges. If you are in any doubt, get permission before taking photos. There are sensitivities about taking photographs of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>embassies</li>\n  <li>government buildings</li>\n  <li>churches</li>\n  <li>religious buildings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"drones\">Drones</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to use radio-controlled helicopters or drones to take photos near sensitive sites.     </p>\n\n<p>Do not import, use or produce drones in Egypt unless the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.mod.gov.eg/ModWebSite/Default.aspx\">Egyptian Ministry of Defence</a> gives you permission beforehand. Anyone who uses or imports drones without permission could get a prison sentence of up to 7 years or a fine of 5,000 to 50,000 Egyptian pounds.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex sexual activity is not explicitly criminalised in Egypt. However, the Egyptian authorities have prosecuted LGBT+ people under ‘debauchery’ laws, including people flying rainbow flags at public events.</p>\n\n<p>There is little public acceptance of same-sex relationships in Egypt. Same-sex couples showing affection in public are likely to receive negative attention.</p>\n\n<p>Be cautious about sharing content or having discussions of a sexual nature on social media, especially about sexual acts that are considered illegal. Some travellers have been arrested and imprisoned for this.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"child-custody-law\">Child custody law</h3>\n\n<p>Egyptian family law is very different from UK law, particularly around child custody. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/international-parental-child-abduction\">International parental child abduction</a> for information and how to get assistance.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"insurance-for-adventure-activities\">Insurance for adventure activities</h3>\n\n<p>Make sure your travel insurance, or the tour or dive company, will cover the costs for any air or sea rescue, which can cost more than 4,000 US dollars per hour. The Egyptian authorities will only start rescue operations when they are guaranteed payment. Book excursions for activities at your resort or through approved agents or tour operators.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">Foreign travel insurance</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hot-air-balloons\">Hot air balloons</h3>\n\n<p>Speak to your tour company before booking a hot air balloon flight. Some UK tour operators have stopped selling balloon flights because they have not been able to verify safety standards.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"watersports-and-cruises\">Watersports and cruises</h3>\n\n<p>There have been recent incidents involving British nationals on diving boats/tours in the Red Sea. Some of these have included fatalities. Safety standards of Red Sea resort diving operators and boats vary considerably. Some operators may not provide adequate safety and insurance standards.</p>\n\n<p>The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (an independent investigative unit within the Department for Transport) published <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/safety-bulletin-12025-published\">guidance</a> about liveaboard vessels on their website in February 2025. They recommend that prospective customers are advised only to book liveaboard dive holidays through reputable vendors who can provide assurance about the safety standards applicable to the dive boat. On arrival on board, customers should request that the crew provide a thorough safety briefing before departure.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>observe safety standards on board and exercise caution</li>\n  <li>make bookings through your tour representative or reputable operator if possible</li>\n  <li>check the weather and stay alert to changes</li>\n  <li>not dive or snorkel without a dive buddy or guide</li>\n  <li>not dive below your insurance policy’s depth limit – doing so will invalidate your cover</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Shark attacks are rare, but there have been attacks on tourists in the Red Sea region.
