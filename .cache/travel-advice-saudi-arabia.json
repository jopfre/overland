Police have arrested British nationals for disorderly or offensive behaviour when drinking. You can face severe penalties, including prison, for brewing, possessing or selling  alcohol.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-penalties\">Illegal drugs penalties </h3>\n\n<p>There is zero tolerance for drug offences in Saudi Arabia, and the penalties are severe. If you’re arrested for drug offences, you may have a long period of detention before trial. You can get a prison sentence of up to 5 years and a fine of 30,000 Saudi riyals for possessing even small amounts.

Statements made on social media many years ago, or those published outside Saudi Arabia, may be taken into account. Punishment can include long custodial sentences. The legal processes around national security cases can be complex and slow. If you are detained, it may take some time for the Saudi authorities to grant permission for consular officials to visit you.</p>\n\n<p>You’re likely to come under more scrutiny if you’re a British national who also: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>carries Saudi citizenship</li>\n  <li>has close Saudi relatives</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"carrying-2-passports\">Carrying 2 passports </h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to have 2 passports in your name in Saudi Arabia.

In some cases, British Embassy staff have not been allowed to visit immediately or have had limited access. </p>\n\n<p>There is no legal aid in Saudi Arabia. You may want to hire a translator if you need to attend a criminal proceeding. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find/translators-interpreters?country=Saudi%20Arabia\">Find a translator or interpreter in Saudi Arabia</a>. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"unpaid-debts-and-other-financial-crimes\">Unpaid debts and other financial crimes </h3>\n\n<p>You can get a fine, prison sentence or travel ban, or face deportation for financial crimes, including: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>writing a cheque which bounces (including post-dated and ‘security cheques’)  </li>\n  <li>not paying bills (for example hotel bills or car hire)  </li>\n  <li>fraud and bribery</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Saudi authorities can also freeze your bank account or other assets. You may be liable for cheques you signed on behalf of a company. </p>\n\n<p>The Saudi authorities could: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>prevent you from cancelling your residence permit</li>\n  <li>stop you leaving the country</li>\n  <li>block your government services</li>\n  <li>not allow you to renew your residency card, re-entry visa or exit permits</li>\n  <li>stop you transferring to a new employer (sponsor)</li>\n  <li>use your end-of-service benefits to pay outstanding debts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"travel-bans\">Travel bans </h3>\n\n<p>The Saudi authorities may stop you from leaving the country  for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>unpaid debts</li>\n  <li>ongoing commercial, financial or labour disputes</li>\n  <li>legal cases</li>\n  <li>investigations</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you’re under a travel ban,  you cannot leave the country, even if you’re a British national or dual British-Saudi national. They can take years to resolve. If you’re banned from travel, get legal advice.</p>\n\n<p>Government bodies often keep passports for official purposes. Employers (sponsors) may try to hold onto your passport, but this is illegal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"deportation\">Deportation </h3>\n\n<p>If you’re found guilty of an offence and sentenced to over 3 months in prison, the Saudi authorities can deport you. Sometimes the authorities deport people with shorter sentences, regardless of whether the judgement included deportation. If you’re employed in Saudi Arabia, deportation will impact your employment and may affect your ability to return to Saudi Arabia in the future. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers </h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relations are illegal, although legal action is uncommon. All couples should be aware of local customs and avoid showing affection in public. </p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.visitsaudi.com/en\">Visit Saudi</a> says all visitors are welcome, are not required to disclose their personal information and will have their right to privacy respected.  </p>\n\n<p>Being transgender is not recognised in Saudi Arabia.
