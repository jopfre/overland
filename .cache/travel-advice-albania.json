The guide lists driving regulations and other legal requirements you need to be aware of.</p>\n\n<p>You may find it useful to have a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 international driving permit (<abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> as well as your UK licence. The 1949 <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr> is not accepted any more. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>You must carry a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-insurance/driving-abroad\">green card</a> as proof of vehicle insurance to drive your car in Albania. If you’re planning to hire a car, check with your car hire company for information on their requirements before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Check if you need a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/flags-identifiers-and-stickers\">UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you stay longer than one year, or live in Albania, you will need to apply for an Albanian driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>To import a vehicle into Albania, make sure you have all the necessary papers on arrival at the border. Consult the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ambasadat.gov.al/united-kingdom/en\">Albanian Embassy in the UK</a> before you leave. The British Embassy will be unable to help anyone attempting to bring a vehicle into Albania without the correct paperwork.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dangers-of-driving-in-albania\">Dangers of driving in Albania</h3>\n\n<p>Driving can be very hazardous and often aggressive and erratic. Deaths from road traffic accidents are amongst the highest in Europe. Police have taken some measures to decrease the number of accidents.</p>\n\n<p>Minor traffic disputes can quickly escalate, especially as some motorists could be armed. Avoid reacting to provocative behaviour by other road users.</p>\n\n<p>If you are involved in a traffic accident, even a minor one, remain at the scene until the police arrive. This will usually happen quite quickly in built-up areas. Failing to wait could result in charges under the Albanian Penal Code and you could get a fine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-conditions\">Road conditions</h3>\n\n<p>Road surfaces are poor, especially in rural areas. If you are travelling at night, watch out for unmarked roadworks, potholes and vehicles without lights. Four-wheel drive vehicles are more practical on rural and minor roads.</p>\n\n<p>Power cuts can affect street lighting in towns and cities. Elsewhere, even on the major routes, there is no street lighting.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"landmines\">Landmines</h2>\n\n<p>There are still unexploded landmines in some remote areas around hill towns on the northern border with Kosovo. Take care, particularly if hiking, and follow any warning signs. Do not walk on uncultivated land or step off the marked paths. If in doubt, seek local advice.    </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters-\">Extreme weather and natural disasters     </h2>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>There is a risk of earthquakes – tremors are common.

Heavy snowfall in mountainous areas can lead to disruption to transport and services. Monitor local and international media for the latest information.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildfires\">Wildfires</h3>\n\n<p>Wildfires are common in Albania from April to October due to the dry and hot weather. Wildfires are highly dangerous and unpredictable.
