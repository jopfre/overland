Be alert for any security related announcements by the Kazakh authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"protests-and-demonstrations\">Protests and demonstrations</h2>\n\n<p>Public demonstrations are only permitted when authorised by the Kazakh authorities in advance. Occasional unauthorised small-scale public protests take place.

Robberies are uncommon in cities and rural areas but do happen.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid walking alone at night and pre-arrange your transport. Do not use unofficial taxis or a taxi already occupied by a passenger.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Pickpocketing is very common in crowded places such as markets and on public transport.

Alcohol and drugs can reduce your vigilance, making you less in control.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid splitting up from your friends, do not leave drinks unattended and do not go off with people you do not know. Save the location of your accommodation on your maps app, so it’s easy to find. See <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelaware.campaign.gov.uk/#stick_with_your_mates\">TravelAware ‘Stick with your mates’</a> for tips and advice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>Kazakhstan has a secular constitution.

Police patrolling the streets may ask for your ID, and copies are not acceptable. You need to show your original ID to enter state buildings.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan </h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. Cafés and restaurants may amend their menus and be busy around fast-breaking (‘Iftar’). Areas around mosques are also likely to be busy around prayer times. Take particular care not to offend religious sensitivities at this time.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans </h3>\n\n<p>Shops are not allowed to sell alcohol between 11pm and 8am. Alcoholic drinks which have an alcohol content level of more than 30% cannot be sold in shops between 9pm and 12 noon. Bars, restaurants and cafés are not covered by this rule.</p>\n\n<p>If police find you drinking alcohol in the street, or if you appear to be drunk, they can take you to a police station and issue you with a fine or detain you in a police cell overnight.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking-and-e-cigarette-bans\">Smoking and e-cigarette bans </h3>\n\n<p>Smoking and vaping are illegal in and near to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>schools and playgrounds</li>\n  <li>healthcare facilities</li>\n  <li>public places – museums, libraries, cinemas, sport centres, public transport, nightclubs, airports, rail stations and underpasses</li>\n  <li>cars with children travelling</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The fine for smoking in an unauthorised place is around £90, and more if it’s a repeat offence. </p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to sell, distribute, import or produce smokeless cigarettes, e-cigarettes (vapes), or e-liquid for e-cigarettes.
