Keep valuables out of sight and do not use mobiles or laptops while in traffic. When driving, keep doors locked and windows closed. Do not respond if anyone signals you to pull over. Thieves may fake a minor traffic incident to get you out of your car. If they succeed, they may rob you and also steal the car. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault </h3>\n\n<p>Incidents of rape have been reported in popular nightlife areas, as well as in private homes. Never travel alone at night.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences  </h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID </h3>\n\n<p>Always carry ID – it is safest to carry a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/certifying-a-document\">certified copy your passport’s photo page</a>. If travelling outside of Luanda and the provincial capitals, take the originals with you, packed as securely as you can. If you do not have any ID, you may get an on-the-spot fine of 15,000 kwanzas. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences </h3>\n\n<p>Drug taking and smuggling are offences. Punishments can be severe and prison conditions are very poor. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas </h3>\n\n<p>Do not use cameras, binoculars or GPS equipment near any government buildings. Taking photographs in the streets can draw the attention of the authorities and they may confiscate your camera. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers </h3>\n\n<p>In January 2019, Angola’s parliament made it illegal to discriminate against people on the basis of sexual orientation. However, public attitudes towards same-sex relationships are less tolerant than in the UK.

To reduce the risk of breakdowns or accidents, use off-road vehicles for longer journeys. Outside major towns, foreign visitors usually travel in convoys of at least 2 vehicles for safety and in case of breakdowns. </p>\n\n<p>Although you can drive on a UK photocard licence for up to 30 days, it is helpful to get the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1949 version of the international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> as well. Make sure you have your driving licence, <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>, and ownership and insurance documents in the car. You will need to show them at the frequent police checkpoints. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-conditions-and-landmines\">Road conditions and landmines </h3>\n\n<p>Roads outside Luanda and the provincial capitals are often in poor condition. Landmines and unexploded bombs and weapons are still a problem on roads, verges and bridges.  </p>\n\n<p>During the rainy season from November to April there is an increased chance of mines shifting due to flooding and resurfacing outside known mine fields. </p>\n\n<p>There have been incidents where mines have exploded with loss of life in places previously thought to be safe. Even in ‘cleared’ areas, keep to well-established routes and take up-to-date advice from the United Nations or an international non-governmental organisation. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis-and-minibuses\">Taxis and minibuses </h3>\n\n<p>Book airport taxis in advance using your hotel or travel operator. In most cases your sponsor will arrange to meet you at the airport and to provide transport throughout your trip.  </p>\n\n<p>For taxi travel in Angola, always use pre-booked taxis. You can book using apps, including ‘Yango’ and ‘Heetch’. Check the driver’s identity details match before getting in. Local minibus transport is unsafe.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel </h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list#angola\">UK Air Safety List (ASL)</a> lists all known airlines in Angola that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to and from the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters </h2>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding </h3>\n\n<p>During the rainy season from November to April, there are storms and heavy downpours.
