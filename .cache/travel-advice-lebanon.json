Military activity, including airstrikes, cannot be ruled out. Tensions remain high and the situation could deteriorate with little warning. The closure or disruption of roads and exit routes at short notice could affect your ability to leave the country. Do not rely on the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> being able to evacuate you in an emergency.</p>\n\n<p>The security situation presents a range of serious risks to British Nationals in Lebanon, including the following.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"military-activity-across-lebanon\">Military activity across Lebanon</h3>\n\n<p>There are ongoing mortar and artillery exchanges across Lebanon, primarily on the boundary with Israel. Other areas of the country have also been affected including Beirut, the Beqaa Valley and locations north of the Litani river. The <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> is aware that many people are returning to the south of Lebanon. Be aware that the Israeli Defence Force is continuing to tell people not to return to areas in the south close to the Blue Line and are imposing curfews.</p>\n\n<p>Further air-strikes in Lebanon cannot be ruled out. Strikes have resulted in civilian casualties and the destruction of residential buildings.

Remain alert to local conditions as these could change quickly.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"civil-disorder\">Civil disorder</h3>\n\n<p>Celebratory gunfire is common in Lebanon and there is a risk from gunfire being fired in residential areas in reaction to major regional developments.

Exercise caution, avoid demonstrations, and monitor local media for developments.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-support\">Local support</h3>\n\n<p>The Embassy remains open as normal and continues with essential work, including full services to British nationals.

These may be valid for a different time period. In April 2024, Lebanese authorities introduced new increased rates for residence permits of foreign nationals.

If your name matches an entry on the database, you may be detained (or occasionally allowed entry by surrendering your passport) until they can be satisfied that the record does not relate to you. You might be able to do this by producing a copy of a birth certificate or other official documentation that allows parents’ names to be checked against the database.

Groups within Lebanon, including Hizballah, are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Counter Terrorism (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. Offences committed under the act – including funding and supporting proscribed organisations – may be liable to prosecution in the UK.  </p>\n\n<p>Terrorist groups have particularly operated in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Tripoli</li>\n  <li>Palestinian refugee camps</li>\n  <li>areas close to the Syrian border, including around Hermel and Aarsal</li>\n  <li>Southern suburbs of Beirut</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Recent terrorist-related incidents include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>In 2023, the Lebanese Armed Forces uncovered a cell planning attacks on military sites and prisons</li>\n  <li>in 2022, the police uncovered a terrorist network who were planning 3 simultaneous attacks in the southern suburbs of Beirut</li>\n  <li>in 2021, the Lebanese Armed Forces dismantled a suspected ISIS cell accused of killing of a retired intelligence officer planning further attacks</li>\n  <li>in 2020, following the arrest of an individual suspected of preparing to conduct terrorist attacks in Beirut, there were police and military casualties in 2 security incidents linked to the disruption of further terrorist cells</li>\n  <li>in 2020, 3 municipal police officers were shot and killed in Kaftoun, Koura in North Lebanon</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures have been in place on flights departing from Lebanon to the UK since March 2017. You should co-operate fully with security officials.</p>\n\n<p>If you notice or suspect a security incident is underway, leave the area immediately. Suspects have detonated explosives to avoid arrest. Keep clear of affected areas immediately after any attacks. Bystanders have been killed in a number of terrorist attacks in recent years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorist-kidnap\">Terrorist kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>There’s a threat of kidnapping in Lebanon. The Lebanese authorities have warned that foreigners could be targeted.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release.</p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British Government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British Government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"security-situation\">Security situation</h2>\n\n<p>The security situation in Lebanon is volatile and can deteriorate quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Violence may occur:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>as a result of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon#conflict-in-neighbouring-israel-and-the-occupied-palestinian-territories-opts\">conflict affecting Lebanon</a>\n</li>\n  <li>between security forces and protestors</li>\n  <li>between supporters of political groups</li>\n  <li>over scarce or subsidised resources</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Confrontations often happen without warning, and can result in large numbers of casualties. Security forces may use tear gas and rubber bullets during clashes.</p>\n\n<p>Weapons are common in Lebanon and groups such as Hizballah have arms that are beyond state control. Arguments can quickly escalate into violence, including the use of weapons, typically firearms and bladed weapons.</p>\n\n<p>Celebratory gunfire is illegal in Lebanon but remains widespread. Every year there are reported casualties.</p>\n\n<p>Regional and international developments such as in Syria, Iraq and Israel, can have an impact on the local security situation. Monitor the regional situation whilst in Lebanon.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"security-advice-for-british-nationals\">Security advice for British nationals</h3>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid large crowds and political gatherings</li>\n  <li>take cover in a building and move away from windows in areas where there’s celebratory or other gunfire</li>\n  <li>be especially vigilant during periods of religious significance (including the holy month of Ramadan) and public holidays</li>\n  <li>monitor this travel advice and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/lebanon/email-signup\">sign up for email updates</a>\n</li>\n  <li>make sure you have correct and up-to-date travel documents, including a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports\">passport</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-to-come-to-the-uk\">visa</a> if necessary, for yourself and anyone you are travelling with (even if they are not a British national) in case a sudden deterioration in the security situation means you need to leave Lebanon</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If there are widespread disturbances or the security situation deteriorates, there may be limits to the assistance that the British Embassy Beirut can provide. Be prepared to shelter in place for several days, if the security situation requires it. This means having enough essential supplies, such as food, water and medicine, at the place where you are staying. Do not rely on the <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> being able to evacuate you in an emergency.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"severe-economic-crisis\">Severe economic crisis</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"currency\">Currency</h3>\n\n<p>Lebanon is experiencing a prolonged economic crisis. This may affect your ability to pay for goods and services. US dollars are widely accepted and are the main cash currency, including in most supermarkets, restaurants and other retail outlets. It is difficult to access US dollars locally and many companies do not accept credit/debit cards. Plan accordingly and ensure you have access to adequate cash for the length of your stay.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"power-cuts\">Power cuts</h3>\n\n<p>Lebanon’s power plants are only producing limited electricity for the national grid. This can lead to power cuts across the country, with an impact on services, such as transport, internet, water and waste collection, and shops, cafes and restaurants. Before travelling, check with your hotel whether they are affected by power cuts. Have a torch to hand at night and plan how you would leave your accommodation in the dark.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>There is moderate risk to tourists from petty or violent crime. However, crime has increased due to the declining economic situation. Theft, vehicle theft and robbery in particular have risen. Take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>consider your route and vary daily routines</li>\n  <li>hide expensive-looking jewellery, which could draw unwanted attention</li>\n  <li>avoid carrying large amounts of cash in public</li>\n  <li>be aware of your surroundings when using ATMs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Members of the public have held up banks across Lebanon in order to access their savings, using both real and replica firearms. This may well continue. Be alert when in or near banks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>There has been an increase in reported incidents of sexual harassment and assault in public areas, including while walking in Beirut. Consider whether it is safe to walk alone, particularly in less busy areas. Due to the lack of electricity, streetlights often do not work, so streets are very dark at night. Consider taking a torch with you at night and make sure your phone is charged in case of an emergency.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drug-smuggling-and-car-theft\">Drug smuggling and car theft</h3>\n\n<p>Criminal gangs involved in drug cultivation and smuggling operate in parts of the Beqaa Valley, especially northern Beqaa. Car theft gangs are prevalent and may carry out armed vehicle theft, particularly along sections of the international highway towards Baalbek. Vehicle thefts (including 4x4s) have increased significantly and are often targeted. Other armed crimes, such as robbery and kidnap, can occur in these areas. There are also frequent armed clashes between gangs and the security forces.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-drones-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras and drones in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid photography in Lebanese Hizballah areas, including the southern suburbs of Beirut, the Beqaa Valley and areas in southern Lebanon. You may be detained if you are observed taking photographs.</p>\n\n<p>Only take photographs in tourist sites. You could be arrested for photographing military sites. Flying drone cameras without permission is illegal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. During this time, be aware of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>eating, drinking, smoking or chewing gum in public in the daytime, including in your car</li>\n  <li>playing loud music or dance</li>\n  <li>swearing in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<p>You should also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes – clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"diversity\">Diversity</h3>\n\n<p>Lebanon’s people are diverse, with many different Muslim and Christian sects represented. Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times and make sure your actions do not offend.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code\">Dress code</h3>\n\n<p>In many areas you will find dress codes more relaxed than in other countries of the region, but you should still dress modestly when visiting religious sites.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Possessing, using and trafficking illegal drugs (including small quantities) are all serious offences, punishable with prison sentences.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>The Lebanese Criminal Code includes a general provision concerning ‘every sexual act against nature’. Lebanese courts might consider that this includes same sex sexual activity. A criminal offence under this provision is punishable by a prison sentence of up to a year. The <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://lebmash.org/resources-for-lgbt-individuals/\">Lebanese Medical Association for Sexual Health</a> has resources for LGBT+ people.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"child-abduction-and-travel-bans\">Child abduction and travel bans</h3>\n\n<p>If you have concerns about child custody, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/child-abduction-accredited-solicitors-referral-list\">get legal advice</a> before travelling to Lebanon about ‘travel bans’ that can be imposed by male heads of family. Even if you or your child holds a British passport you may be subject to Lebanese laws and regulations.</p>\n\n<p>In Lebanon a father or husband can legally arrange for a travel ban to be placed on their wife or children. If a travel ban is placed on you or your children, you will not be able to travel. If that does happen a parent should seek <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find/lawyers/Lebanon/result?\">legal assistance</a> to check if the travel ban can be lifted.</p>\n\n<p>Lebanese family law is very different from UK law and particular care is needed if child custody becomes an issue.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a British national involved in international parental child abductions or custody disputes, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/support-for-british-nationals-abroad\">contact the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>)</a> for assistance or call +44 (0) 2070 085 000. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> has information on international parental child abduction, including how we can help. <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> strongly advises against attempting to move your child yourself. This may be considered abduction (or ‘re-abduction’). This may be illegal and can put your child at risk.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"shared-taxis-and-unofficial-taxis\">Shared taxis and unofficial taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Do not use shared taxis or taxis hailed on the street. In 2017, the Lebanese Interior Minister advised people in Lebanon not to use Uber taxis.</p>\n\n<p>Only use taxis:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>from recognised companies that use vetted drivers</li>\n  <li>recognised by hotels, which are safe and well-maintained</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There have been armed robberies and physical attacks against passengers in shared taxis (known locally as service taxis) with passengers being attacked by either the driver or other passengers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>You need either a 1968 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit (<abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> or a UK driving licence to drive in Lebanon. The 1949 <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr> is not accepted anymore. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Lebanon, see information on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards are poor and the accident rate is high. Traffic lights are often switched off and not always observed. It may be better to hire a car with a driver if you’re inexperienced. You must wear a seat belt (if fitted). Avoid travelling at night outside towns if possible. Vehicles with diesel engines are banned.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"licences-and-permits\">Licences and permits</h3>\n\n<p>Carry ID with you at all times and be prepared to stop at checkpoints to show your papers. The army has set up checkpoints on major and minor roads.</p>\n\n<p>Temporary local licences are also available, but they take longer to get and are more expensive than an <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"roadblocks\">Roadblocks</h3>\n\n<p>Protests and roadblocks may restrict travel at short notice. Major roads in and out of Beirut and across the country, including the roads to and from Beirut Rafik Hariri International Airport, have become blocked at short notice. If you’re travelling to or from the airport, check your flight status before leaving and allow extra time for your journey. If roads from the airport are blocked, wait there until the authorities confirm access roads are open.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"landmines\">Landmines</h3>\n\n<p>Landmines and other unexploded weapons are present in Lebanon and are not always clearly marked. Use only well-travelled tracks and do not stray from their edges. Avoid remote abandoned properties. Use local guides and seek local knowledge if you are unsure.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"forest-fires\">Forest fires</h3>\n\n<p>There is a heightened risk of forest fires in Lebanon, particularly during summer. Forest fires are highly dangerous and unpredictable. Take care when visiting or driving through woodland areas. The authorities may evacuate areas and close roads for safety.</p>\n\n<p>If you are travelling in Lebanon, familiarise yourself with local safety and emergency procedures, stay vigilant, and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>For information on the risk of forest fires, visit the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://drm.pcm.gov.lb/\">Disaster Risk Management website</a>, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/drmleb/\">Facebook page</a> and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://X.com/DRM_Lebanon\">X account</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you see a forest fire, call the emergency services on 112 (for the fire service, call 175).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Lebanon is in an earthquake zone. There have been no damaging tremors in recent years, although Lebanon experienced strong aftershocks from an earthquake in Turkey in February 2023.

See <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/lebanon\">Palestinian refugee camp locations</a> on the UN Relief and Works Agency website.</p>\n\n<p>Palestinian refugee camps are volatile environments where the Lebanese state has limited capacity to impose law and order.
