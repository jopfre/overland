These include references to attacks on western interests, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>residential compounds</li>\n  <li>military sites</li>\n  <li>oil</li>\n  <li>transport and aviation interests</li>\n  <li>restaurants and hotels</li>\n  <li>beaches</li>\n  <li>shopping centres</li>\n  <li>mosques</li>\n  <li>large demonstrations</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"regional-escalation\">Regional escalation</h2>\n\n<p>Ongoing hostilities in the region and between Israel and Lebanon could escalate quickly and pose risks for the wider region.</p>\n\n<p>On 1 October, Iran launched around 200 ballistic missiles at Israel. On 26 October Israel carried out military action against Iran.</p>\n\n<p>Monitor this travel advice and other media as the situation is changing fast.

Be aware of local sensitivities on these issues. Follow news reports and avoid public gatherings and demonstrations. There is the potential for increased tension on Fridays.</p>\n\n<p>If any incidents occur, monitor local media reports and follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Crime levels are low, but take sensible precautions to protect yourself and your belongings.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Female visitors and residents should take care when walking or travelling alone, particularly at night. Always use pre-booked taxis from reputable taxi companies or recognised taxi apps. Check the registration number and confirm that the driver has your name. Let someone know you are on the way and give them the registration details of the car.</p>\n\n<p>Personal attacks, including sexual assault and rape, are relatively rare, but do happen. Qatari law places a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that sexual relations were not consensual.  If the court determines sex was consensual, the victim or attacker may still face prosecution for the offence of sex outside of marriage.</p>\n\n<p>If you have been sexually assaulted, contact the British Embassy in Doha on 00 974 4496 2000. You can also read our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/qatar-information-for-victims-of-rape-and-sexual-assault/guidance-for-victims-of-rape-and-sexual-assault-in-qatar\">guidance for victims of rape or sexual assault in Qatar</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>Qatar is an Islamic country. Respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions. Make sure your actions do not cause offence, especially during the holy month of Ramadan or when visiting religious areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You must always carry your passport as an official form of identification. A copy is usually acceptable, but in some situations you may have to produce the original at a police station within a specified time limit.</p>\n\n<p>If you live in Qatar, your residence card is acceptable.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code\">Dress code</h3>\n\n<p>Dress modestly in public, including while driving:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>women should cover their shoulders and not wear short skirts</li>\n  <li>men and women should not wear shorts or sleeveless tops in government buildings, healthcare facilities or shopping malls - if you do, you may be asked to leave or be denied entry</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. Ramadan in Qatar in 2025 will  likely start on 28 February and will last approximately 30 days. During this time, do not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in your car</li>\n  <li>play loud music or dance</li>\n  <li>swear in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<p>You should also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes  – clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n  <li>be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk</li>\n  <li>be patient and show tolerance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>Only licensed hotels, restaurants and bars can sell alcohol. Expatriates living in Qatar can get alcohol on a permit system. Don’t carry alcohol around with you (except to take it on the day of collection from the warehouse to your home). The legal drinking age in Qatar is 21. Places serving alcohol will ask for original photo IDs (copies are not accepted) upon entry.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to drink alcohol or be drunk in public. For example, if you drink in a non-licenced public place, you could get a prison sentence of up to 6 months or a fine up to 3,000 Qatari riyals.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"relationships-outside-marriage\">Relationships outside marriage</h3>\n\n<p>Any intimacy in public, between any couples (including between teenagers), can lead to arrest.</p>\n\n<p>Couples living together while unmarried is illegal in Qatar. Sex outside marriage is illegal for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. You can be arrested and punishments can include a fine, a custodial sentence and deportation once the sentence is complete.</p>\n\n<p>Because of laws on sex outside marriage, if someone becomes pregnant outside marriage, both partners could face imprisonment or deportation. Doctors will ask for proof of marriage during antenatal checks.</p>\n\n<p>An unmarried woman who gives birth in Qatar may also face problems registering the birth of the child in Qatar, and could be arrested, imprisoned or deported. To get a birth certificate from the Qatari authorities, you must provide a marriage certificate. Authorities may compare the marriage date against the estimated date of conception.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Qatar. See our <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">information and advice page</a> for the LGBT+ community before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protests\">Protests</h3>\n\n<p>Organisers of protests need to get permission from the Ministry of Interior. This must be done in advance and cannot be spontaneous.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swearing-and-rude-gestures\">Swearing and rude gestures</h3>\n\n<p>Swearing and making rude gestures are considered obscene acts. You can be jailed or deported. Take particular care when dealing with police and other officials.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking-and-e-cigarette-bans\">Smoking and e-cigarette bans</h3>\n\n<p>Smoking is prohibited in all closed public spaces including educational institutions, healthcare facilities, public transport, malls, restaurants and government buildings.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to vape or use an e-cigarette. Police can arrest you and courts can impose a fine, a prison sentence or deportation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>There is zero tolerance for drugs-related offences in Qatar. Some medications that are legal in other countries are illegal in Qatar. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/qatar/health#bringing-medication-into-qatar\">guidance on medications</a> that you can bring into Qatar.</p>\n\n<p>Penalties for using, trafficking, smuggling and possessing drugs (even residual amounts) are severe. Punishment include lengthy prison sentences, heavy fines and deportation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars\">Using cameras and binoculars</h3>\n\n<p>Be aware of cultural sensitivities when filming or photographing people as taking pictures of people without their consent can cause offense.</p>\n\n<p>Some visitors attempting to film or photograph near religious, military, government or construction sites have been arrested. If in doubt, seek permission.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"journalistic-activity\">Journalistic activity</h3>\n\n<p>Journalists must get permission from the Qatar News Agency (QNA) to film or photograph as part of their work and enter the country on a visiting press permit. This permit allows you to take technical equipment like cameras through airport customs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"social-media\">Social media</h3>\n\n<p>There are strict privacy laws in Qatar. Posting messages, videos or photos that appear to insult or slander people, or are culturally insensitive, may be considered a crime. Individuals have been detained, prosecuted and convicted for posting this type of material.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"financial-crimes\">Financial crimes</h3>\n\n<p>Financial crimes include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>fraud</li>\n  <li>giving somebody a cheque which bounces (including post-dated and ‘security’ cheques)</li>\n  <li>non-payment of bills (for example hotel bills or car hire)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may also be liable for cheques that you have signed on behalf of a company.</p>\n\n<p>Financial crimes can be punished with:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>imprisonment</li>\n  <li>fines</li>\n  <li>deportation</li>\n  <li>freezing bank accounts and other assets</li>\n  <li>seizing of any end-of-service benefits or bonuses </li>\n  <li>blocking your access to possible future sponsors (employers)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you have unpaid loans or financial commitments you may be prevented from leaving Qatar.</p>\n\n<p>See more details about <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/living-in-qatar#finance\">financial crimes if you are living and working in Qatar</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Qatar, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>You’ll need to have both the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 version of the international driving permit (IDP)</a> and your UK driving licence with you in the car. You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel.   </p>\n\n<p>To drive for longer than 6 months you’ll need to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://hukoomi.gov.qa/en/service/apply-for-new-driving-license\">apply for a Qatari driving licence</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-regulations\">Driving regulations</h3>\n\n<p>The driver and front seat passenger must wear their seat belts at all times. It is illegal to use a mobile phone while driving - you could be fined 500 Qatari riyals.</p>\n\n<p>It’s illegal to drink and drive, and there is zero tolerance for it. Driving under the influence of any amount of alcohol is punishable by a prison sentence of between one month and 3 years or a fine of 10,000 to 50,000 Qatari riyals, or both. Offenders may also be deported.</p>\n\n<p>Even minor expressions of ‘road rage’ like rude gestures can attract significant penalties. You may be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>fined</li>\n  <li>imprisoned</li>\n  <li>deported</li>\n  <li>banned from leaving the country until your case has been resolved – serious cases may take up to 6 months to be heard</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://portal.moi.gov.qa/metrash2/en/index.html\">Metrash2 app</a> before trying to leave the country, which lists any outstanding traffic violations. If you have an outstanding violation, you could be detained at immigration and denied onward travel. Fines for all violations should be settled in full before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-safety\">Road safety</h3>\n\n<p>Road discipline is very poor; speeds are high and accidents are common. A driver flashing their lights can mean they are coming through rather than giving way.</p>\n\n<p>If you have an accident, stay with your vehicle until the police arrive and tell you that you can leave. It’s illegal to leave the scene of the accident, but if no one has been injured and it’s safe to do so, you can move your vehicle to a safer place. You’ll need to get a police report for insurance purposes. Accident investigation processes and punishments for violations may be different to the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"desert-drives\">Desert drives</h3>\n\n<p>Excursions to the desert can be hazardous unless in a properly-equipped 4x4 vehicle. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>travel in convoy with other cars</li>\n  <li>take a supply of water and a mobile telephone</li>\n  <li>leave travel plans with friends or relatives</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling by dhow. The safety of these vessels may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available.</p>\n\n<p>Many areas of the Gulf are highly sensitive, including near maritime boundaries and the islands of Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the southern Gulf. Vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected, and there have been occasional arrests. Make careful enquiries before entering these waters or visiting ports.</p>\n\n<p>Regional tensions may also affect your route. Vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, Northern Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Bab El Mandeb regions may be at increased risk of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">maritime attack</a>.</p>\n\n","slug":"safety-and-security","title":"Safety and security"},{"body":"<p>Before you travel, check that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>your destination can provide the healthcare you may need</li>\n  <li>you have <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">appropriate travel insurance</a> for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"emergency-medical-number\">Emergency medical number</h2>\n\n<p>Dial 999 and ask for an ambulance.</p>\n\n<p>Contact your insurance or medical assistance company promptly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccine-recommendations-and-health-risks\">Vaccine recommendations and health risks</h2>\n\n<p>At least 8 weeks before your trip:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check the latest <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/183/qatar#Vaccine_Recommendations\">vaccine recommendations for Qatar</a>\n</li>\n  <li>see where to get vaccines and whether you have to pay on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/travel-vaccinations/\">NHS travel vaccinations page</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/183/qatar\">what health risks you’ll face in Qatar</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"medication\">Medication</h2>\n\n<p>The legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or bought in the UK can be different in other countries.</p>\n\n<p>TravelHealthPro explains <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/43/medicines-abroad\">best practice when travelling with medicines</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bringing-medication-into-qatar\">Bringing medication into Qatar</h3>\n\n<p>Some prescribed and over-the-counter medicines may be controlled substances in Qatar.
