Using your submission receipt, you then collect and pay for your visa at the airport.

You can pay by card, but you should have cash as a back-up, with US dollars being the preferred currency.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://nepaliport.immigration.gov.np/onlinevisa-mission/application\">apply for a tourist visa in advance</a> and collect it from the Nepal Embassy in the UK or in another country. Applying in advance can reduce the time it takes to pass through immigration.</p>\n\n<p>Visas are available for several lengths of stay at various costs. Look on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.immigration.gov.np/\">immigration department website for the options</a>.    </p>\n\n<p>You can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://nepaliport.immigration.gov.np/\">extend your visa online</a> to up to a total of 150 days in one year.</p>\n\n<p>Overstaying your visa in Nepal is a serious crime and can lead to significant fines or imprisonment.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccine-requirements\">Vaccine requirements</h2>\n\n<p>To enter Nepal, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission\">country listed as a transmission risk</a>\n</li>\n  <li>a polio vaccine, if you’re coming from certain countries with a transmission risk</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/159/nepal#Vaccine_Recommendations\">TravelHealthPro’s Nepal guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Nepal. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.</p>\n\n<p>Bringing precious metals into Nepal is strictly regulated. You can carry gold ornaments up to 50 grams and silver ornaments up to 100 grams. If you bring in undeclared gold or silver, you may:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>get a fine equivalent to the value of the goods</li>\n  <li>go to prison for between one month and 5 years depending upon the value of the goods</li>\n  <li>have the goods confiscated</li>\n  <li>be detained during the proceedings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"taking-money-into-and-out-of-nepal\">Taking money into and out of Nepal</h3>\n\n<p>You must declare on a customs form on arrival any amount above the value of 5,000 US dollars in banknotes or 10,000 dollars in notes and travellers cheques combined. Customs will give a certified declaration, which you must keep.</p>\n\n<p>You will need to convert all your Nepali currency before you leave Nepal, and the bank or exchange counter at the airport may ask you for the declaration.</p>\n\n<p>ATMs are not reliable outside main tourist sites.</p>\n\n","slug":"entry-requirements","title":"Entry requirements"},{"body":"<h2 id=\"terrorism\">Terrorism</h2>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.</p>\n\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorism-in-nepal\">Terrorism in Nepal</h3>\n\n<p>Although there’s no recent history of terrorism in Nepal, attacks cannot be ruled out.</p>\n\n<p>Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreign nationals. Be vigilant in public places and take local advice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"civil-disorder\">Civil disorder</h2>\n\n<p>Political protests, demonstrations and strikes are fairly common in Nepal. A number of groups have stated their intent to organise protests or political rallies in Kathmandu and elsewhere across the country. They can start at short notice and may lead to clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Protests cause disruption to transport and the authorities may increase the police presence. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid any demonstrations</li>\n  <li>check local media for updates</li>\n  <li>follow the direction of local authorities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>There’s a low rate of serious crime in Nepal, but take precautions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-yourself-and-your-belongings\">Protecting yourself and your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Watch out for pickpockets and bag-snatchers, particularly in airports, on buses and in areas popular with foreign nationals like Thamel, Sanepa and Kupondol in Kathmandu.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when walking around at night. Assaults and robberies are more likely in the evening in poorly lit areas. Avoid walking on your own and do not carry large sums of cash. Keep valuables in a hotel safe if possible.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Women have been sexually assaulted in tourist areas such as Thamel and Sanepa in Kathmandu. Be cautious, especially when alone after dark. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">Advice for women travelling abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-spiking\">Drink spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Be wary of accepting drinks from strangers and do not leave drinks unattended.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>There have been isolated reports of some trekking guides taking inexperienced trekkers to high altitudes too quickly, and then calling in expensive helicopter medivacs from which the guides take a cut. Be wary of trekking deals that look very cheap and may be scams.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You should carry your passport with you. Leave a copy in a safe place or with friends and family in the UK.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"visiting-holy-places\">Visiting holy places</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid wearing shorts and sleeveless tops in temples and other holy places. Remove shoes before entering certain holy places. Non-Hindus are not permitted inside certain parts of Hindu temples.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Penalties for drugs related offences are severe. If you are caught with even small amounts of marijuana, you can go to prison for over 5 years, usually after a long and expensive legal process.</p>\n\n<p>Some skincare products and e-cigarette refills may contain ingredients that are illegal in Nepal such as cannabidiol (<abbr title=\"cannabidiol\">CBD</abbr>). If the police find you with products containing <abbr title=\"cannabidiol\">CBD</abbr>, they may seize them and charge you with drug possession.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Nepal is generally open and tolerant to LGBT+ issues, and same-sex relations are not illegal. However, showing affection in public, irrespective of sexuality or gender, is viewed by Nepalis as inappropriate.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildlife-animal-products-and-souvenirs\">Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs</h3>\n\n<p>It’s illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any wild animal or trade its parts without a licence. Nepal is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which bans trade of wildlife products without a permit. If you are caught buying or trafficking such goods, or knowingly assisting anyone to do so, you will get a fine or a prison sentence.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"trekking-in-nepal\">Trekking in Nepal</h3>\n\n<p>You need a valid permit and a Trekking Information Management System (<abbr title=\"Trekking Information Management System\">TIMS</abbr>) card to enter Nepal’s main trekking regions. See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://ntb.gov.np/en/plan-your-trip/before-you-come/tims-card\">Nepal Tourism Board <abbr title=\"Trekking Information Management System\">TIMS</abbr> card requirement</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<p>Do not trek alone. All foreign independent trekkers (FITs) must use a local guide or porter while trekking in Nepal’s national parks and protected areas. Always observe national park regulations and follow your guide’s instructions.</p>\n\n<p>If you ignore the requirements, you may be fined or removed from protected areas. Check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://ntb.gov.np/en/latest-travel-updates\">Nepal Tourism Board website</a> for further information or updates.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware of hazards all year round, especially above 3,000m. There could be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>sudden weather changes and potential storms</li>\n  <li>avalanches and snow drifts</li>\n  <li>landslides, rockfalls and flooding</li>\n  <li>glacial crevasses and hollows</li>\n  <li>altitude sickness</li>\n  <li>sun exposure</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To reduce your risk:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>use a reputable trekking agency or guide</li>\n  <li>take note of weather forecasts and conditions</li>\n  <li>make sure you’re physically fit and have not overestimated your abilities</li>\n  <li>take warm clothes and wet weather gear</li>\n  <li>use sun block (SPF20 or higher) and sunglasses</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Make sure your insurance includes cover for mountain rescue services and helicopter costs.</p>\n\n<p>You can get <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/taan.np/\">live updates on trekking conditions in Nepal</a>. You can also follow <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.dhm.gov.np/\">national weather forecasts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Internal flights in high mountain areas can be delayed by poor weather conditions and cancellations are common. Carry enough funds in case of delays, particularly in remote areas, where ATMs may not be available and credit cards not accepted.</p>\n\n<p>In remote areas, including long stretches of the Annapurna Circuit trek, mobile phone coverage is limited. Consider renting a satellite phone and make sure your friends and family know you will be out of contact.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"volunteering-and-adventure-travel\">Volunteering and adventure travel</h3>\n\n<p>Research any organisation or company you’re planning to use before committing yourself. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/safer-adventure-travel-and-volunteering-overseas\">Volunteering and adventure travel</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Nepal’s Social Welfare Council has a list of registered volunteer organisations. You can ask for a copy by sending an email to: <a href=\"mailto:info@swc.org.np\">info@swc.org.np</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The British Embassy has received reports of volunteer opportunities at orphanages which are profit-orientated organisations rather than charities. If you’re volunteering at this type of organisation, you could be contributing to child exploitation. Contact the Nepali Central Child Welfare Board on +977 1-5010045 and 5010046 to check before signing up to volunteer for one of these organisations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re planning to drive in Nepal, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a> and read the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://internationaldriversassociation.com/nepal-driving-guide\">International Drivers Association Nepal driving guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You need a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 international driving permit (<abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> and your UK driving licence to drive in Nepal. The 1949 <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr> is not accepted any more. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Always carry your <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr> when driving, as well as your vehicle registration documents.</p>\n\n<p>Road accidents are a major cause of death and disability in Nepal. The causes include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>overloading vehicles</li>\n  <li>negligence of drivers</li>\n  <li>mechanical failure</li>\n  <li>speeding</li>\n  <li>poor road conditions</li>\n  <li>an increasing number of unregulated private vehicles</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Road conditions are poor, especially during the monsoon season or in mountain areas.  </p>\n\n<p>By law only the driver of a vehicle is required to wear a seatbelt, or a helmet when driving a motorbike. You can still use seatbelts for passengers, which are fitted in some taxis. Motorbike rentals will always provide helmets for passengers if requested.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bus-travel\">Bus travel</h3>\n\n<p>Bus accidents are common in Nepal and there are a number of accidents resulting in fatalities every year. Buses are often overcrowded, poorly regulated and poorly maintained. Speeding, low driving standards and poor road conditions contribute to the risk of accidents. Do not travel on overloaded or overcrowded buses, or at night. Tourist buses usually offer a higher standard of comfort and safety.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>Engineering and improvement works will take place at Nepal’s main international airport in Kathmandu from November until March 2025. This may impact airport operations and cause disruption or delays to flights (domestic and international). Check with your tour operator or airline before travelling.</p>\n\n<p>Air crashes can have a variety of causes and are not necessarily linked with poor safety standards or non-compliance with international safety standards. However, there have been a number of fatal accidents and air crashes across Nepal in the commercial air transport sector, involving planes and helicopters. Over the last 5 years, this includes a number of separate incidents and at least 100 deaths.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List (<abbr title=\"Air Safety List\">ASL</abbr>)</a> lists all known airlines in Nepal that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to or from the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering whether to fly and which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Currently no Nepali airline meets the international safety standards and so all are listed on the <abbr title=\"Air Safety List\">ASL</abbr>. This means they are all banned from operating commercial air services to or from the UK.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/extreme-weather-and-natural-hazards\">prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"monsoon\">Monsoon</h3>\n\n<p>Travel during the monsoon season (June to September) can be hazardous. Flooding and landslides cut off towns and villages for days at a time. If you travel by road during monsoon season you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check the road is open</li>\n  <li>be prepared to change or cancel your plans at short notice</li>\n  <li>make sure any vehicle you travel in is equipped with a winch and ropes in case of landslides</li>\n  <li>take enough supplies to cover any possible delays</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Recent flooding and landslides across much of the country caused disruption to domestic transport by road and air. This may take some time to resolve. Check transport plans with your tour operator and expect delays. Follow advice from local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>The Nepal government <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mfd.gov.np/\">Meteorological Forecasting Division</a> provides weather updates (in English) and flood forecasts during the monsoon. You can also access the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.dhm.gov.np/hydrology/floodMonitoring\">Department of Hydrology and Meteorology flood monitoring service</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Earth tremors are common across Nepal. The lack of emergency equipment and poorly resourced medical facilities is likely to worsen an earthquake’s impact. British Embassy assistance will be slow to reach you if you are in a remote area.</p>\n\n<p>The National Society of Earthquake Technology (NSET) gives <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nset.org.np/\">advice on what to do in an earthquake</a>, including ‘<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.nset.org.np/nset2012/index.php/menus/menuid-62/submenuid-90\">Ten tips on earthquake safety</a>’. Check with your tour operator to find out what contingency plans they have for an earthquake.</p>\n\n<p>Following a significant earthquake you should expect transport, accommodation and basic services in affected areas to be disrupted. Relief efforts are likely to be a priority for the authorities. Check with your tour company or hotel for further information on whether travel to an area is possible or appropriate.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"building-safety\">Building safety </h2>\n\n<p>Building, fire and electrical protection standards in Nepal are not always the same as in the UK. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>be aware of electrocution risks, for example, exposed wiring</li>\n  <li>check fire precautions, including access to fire exits</li>\n  <li>check whether your accommodation has a working fire alarm</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Be aware of the risks of exposure to carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is a highly poisonous gas that is impossible to detect without an alarm. It can be produced by fires, charcoal grills or incorrectly installed gas equipment, and a lack of appropriate ventilation is dangerous.

Healthcare is poor in most places outside the Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara. It may be difficult to get rapid helicopter evacuation if you fall ill or suffer a serious accident in a remote area of the country. Make sure you have adequate travel health insurance and accessible funds to cover the cost of any medical treatment abroad, repatriation and evacuation by helicopter.
