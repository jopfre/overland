The Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office (<abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr>) advises against all but essential travel to these provinces.</p>\n\n<p>Martial law is in place in most areas in these provinces, which means security forces have greater security enforcement and investigative powers. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/thailand/regional-risks\">Regional risks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, terrorist attacks could take place anywhere in Thailand. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreign nationals. Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Targets might include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>security forces</li>\n  <li>government offices</li>\n  <li>hotels</li>\n  <li>shops and supermarkets</li>\n  <li>transport infrastructure</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>The political situation can be unpredictable and has led to periods of civil and political unrest.

Companies may hold on to passports against claimed damage.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-crime\">Violent crime</h3>\n\n<p>Violent crime, including gun crime, rarely involves tourists. However, several foreign nationals were victims of gun violence in Bangkok in 2018. Take care when travelling in unfamiliar areas and avoid walking through isolated areas alone, especially at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Violent sexual assaults and unprovoked attacks can happen in tourist areas across Thailand. Attacks are most common during full moon parties or similar events, and near bars late at night.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-spiking-alcohol-and-assaults\">Drink spiking, alcohol and assaults</h3>\n\n<p>Drink spiking and drug-assisted sexual assault does happen in tourist areas around Thailand, with male and female victims. Do not leave your drinks unattended or accept drinks from strangers. Pre-arrange your transport home so you do not have to accept lifts in unlicensed vehicles.  </p>\n\n<p>Drinks served in bars are often stronger than those in the UK. Alcohol and drugs can make you less alert and more vulnerable to accidents, injuries, robbery and assaults.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"methanol-poisoning\">Methanol poisoning</h3>\n\n<p>Alcoholic drinks containing methanol have killed people and caused serious illness. There is a risk of methanol poisoning from home brewed alcohol or counterfeit replicas of well-known alcohol brands. Affected drinks may include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>local spirits, including rice wine</li>\n  <li>spirit-based mixed drinks such as cocktails</li>\n  <li>counterfeit brand-name spirits</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To protect yourself from methanol poisoning you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>buy alcoholic drinks only from licensed liquor stores, bars, clubs, restaurants, and hotels</li>\n  <li>avoid home-made alcoholic drinks</li>\n  <li>check bottle seals are intact</li>\n  <li>check labels for poor print quality or incorrect spelling</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If the label, smell or taste seems wrong, do not drink the alcohol. These are signs it is illegal and could contain methanol. TravelHealthPro lists the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/25/personal-safety\">symptoms of methanol poisoning</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Seek <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-medical-facilities-in-vietnam\">urgent medical attention</a> if you or someone you are travelling with show signs of methanol poisoning.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bank-card-fraud\">Bank card fraud</h3>\n\n<p>Be aware of card fraud. Do not lose sight of your card during transactions. There have been incidents of ATM skimming. Use an ATM in a bank and always protect your PIN.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"job-scams\">Job scams</h3>\n\n<p>Be wary of job offers that appear too good to be true. People have arrived in Thailand and been illegally transported to neighbouring countries on the promise of high-paying jobs, which turn out to be scams. When you re-enter Thailand you may then be detained while your immigration status is validated.</p>\n\n<p>There have been incidents of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>passports confiscated by scammers</li>\n  <li>victims being held in poor living conditions</li>\n  <li>coercion into undertaking wider online scamming activity</li>\n  <li>pressure to make large payments to be released from sham jobs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>The British Embassy in Bangkok’s video talks about what to be aware of when living or travelling in Thailand:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ukinthailand/videos/2132346856805703/\">Facebook – visiting Thailand video</a></li>\n  <li><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://x.com/ukinthailand/status/1002378124200329216\">X – visiting Thailand video</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"criticising-the-thai-monarchy\">Criticising the Thai monarchy</h3>\n\n<p>Criticising the Thai monarchy (‘lèse-majesté’) is illegal. The law can be interpreted broadly and carries a long prison sentence. British and Thai journalists, human rights defenders and members of the public have faced charges for making political comments or sharing articles online that could be interpreted as being negative towards the institution of the Thai monarchy. The law also covers any accusations about members of the Thai Royal Family, past and present.   </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"images-on-social-media\">Images on social media</h3>\n\n<p>Posting images of people drinking alcohol or wearing clothing considered inappropriate can be illegal. Both the person who uploaded the images and the people in them could be fined or imprisoned.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Police may ask to check your passport. If you do not have it with you, you could be asked to produce it within 24 hours at a police station. Usually, a copy of the photo page of your passport will be sufficient. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking-and-e-cigarette-bans\">Smoking and e-cigarette bans</h3>\n\n<p>It’s illegal to smoke in public with a fine of up to 5,000 Thai baht. E-cigarettes are illegal. You could be fined or imprisoned for carrying or using them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Thailand has strict laws against drug use, possession and trafficking. Possessing small quantities of illegal substances can lead to heavy fines or imprisonment. Possessing <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.siam-legal.com/litigation/criminal-defence-drug-offences-in-thailand.php\">Class A drugs</a> can lead to the death penalty.</p>\n\n<p>Conditions in prisons and other detention facilities in Thailand are harsh, with limited access to healthcare. Detainees have died in custody.</p>\n\n<p>Some British nationals have suffered severe psychiatric problems because of drug use, sometimes leading to suicide.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cannabis\">Cannabis</h3>\n\n<p>Using cannabis in public places is illegal. Private recreational use of cannabis is legal if the Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content is below 0.2% by weight. There are still restrictions around growing and selling cannabis products. See more information on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.thailand.go.th/issue-focus-detail/001_07_003-2-2\">Thai government’s website</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>While low-strength cannabis is legal in Thailand, it is likely to be illegal in other countries you travel on to. This includes residual amounts, for example in bags or clothing or in your bloodstream.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to take cannabis out of Thailand without the appropriate export permissions issued by the authorities. Illegally carrying cannabis, particularly large quantities, can lead to heavy fines or imprisonment in Thailand, the UK and other countries you may travel to.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Thailand is generally a safe place for LGBT+ travellers. Thailand legalised same-sex marriage in January 2025. Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildlife-animal-products-and-souvenirs\">Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs</h3>\n\n<p>It’s illegal to buy, sell, kill or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a licence.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buying-property-in-thailand\">Buying property in Thailand</h3>\n\n<p>Buying property in Thailand is not straightforward. Make sure you understand local laws and consult a lawyer before making financial commitments. British people have been victims of property scams.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"elephant-treks\">Elephant treks</h3>\n\n<p>Elephant treks can be dangerous, especially if elephants are mistreated or not handled properly. Use a reliable, licensed tour guide. British nationals have been seriously injured and killed because handlers have lost control of the elephant.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-safety\">Swimming safety</h3>\n\n<p>Take care when swimming off coastal areas, especially during monsoon season. People have drowned in strong riptides. Thailand has lifeguards on duty at designated beaches and operates a flag system for safe swimming. Follow all warning signs, especially red flags.</p>\n\n<p>See <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rlss.org.uk/safety-on-holiday\">water safety on holiday</a> from the Royal Life Saving Society.</p>\n\n<p>Jellyfish can swim close to the shore, particularly during the rainy season from May to October. Jellyfish stings can be fatal. Take local advice from your hotel and dive centres.</p>\n\n<p>Take care when swimming, diving, kayaking or white water rafting in rivers or close to waterfalls, particularly in the rainy season. Currents can be extremely strong.</p>\n\n<p>See ⁠<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rospa.com/leisure-water-safety/water/advice/watersports-abroad\">watersports safety advice</a> from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (ROSPA).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scuba-diving\">Scuba diving</h3>\n\n<p>Diving schools may have limited resources and do not always observe safety and maintenance standards. Always: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>ask to see a dive operator’s credentials</li>\n  <li>check the conditions on your insurance policy – some policies require dive instructors to have certain qualifications</li>\n  <li>make sure safety equipment looks to be in good condition</li>\n  <li>make sure oxygen is available on the boat</li>\n  <li>ask about safety precautions, including the ability to transfer divers to a hyperbaric chamber</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you have not had any previous diving experience, check what to do if something goes wrong, including how to call for help while at sea. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>Thailand has a high number of road traffic accidents, particularly with motorcycles. The World Health Organisation (WHO) ranks Thailand as one of the world’s deadliest countries for <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.who.int/health-topics/road-safety#tab=tab_1\">fatalities on motorcycles</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Thailand, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>. You’ll need to carry both the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1968 version of the international driving permit (<abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> and your UK driving licence while driving. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you live in Thailand, you can apply for a Thai driving licence using your UK driving licence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"car-and-motorcycle-hire\">Car and motorcycle hire</h3>\n\n<p>Motorcycles and scooters for hire in beach resorts are often unregistered and cannot be used legally on a public road. Before you hire a vehicle, make sure your travel insurance covers you and check the small print of the lease agreement. Do not hand over your passport as a guarantee against returning a motorcycle or scooter.</p>\n\n<p>By law, you must wear a helmet when riding a motorcycle.</p>\n\n<p>If you drive a car or ride a motorcycle in Thailand without a valid licence, it could invalidate your travel insurance and you’ll be unable to claim if you have an accident or injury.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>There are many passenger boat services operating between the mainland and islands. Boats can sink or collide, which has led to fatalities, including of British nationals. Accidents are usually due to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>overloading</li>\n  <li>poor maintenance</li>\n  <li>rough seas, particularly during monsoon season</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rainy-season\">Rainy season</h3>\n\n<p>The rainy season is generally from May to October. In Koh Samui and the south-east of Thailand it is from November to March. However, the rainy season has been more unpredictable recently.</p>\n\n<p>Heavy storms cause disruption including flooding and landslides.
