It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Malaysia’s current rules for the most common types of travel.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities in Malaysia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.kln.gov.my/web/gbr_london/\">Malaysian High Commission in the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passport-validity-requirements\">Passport validity requirements</h2>\n\n<p>To enter Malaysia, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive. Make sure it is undamaged, with no pages missing.</p>\n\n<p>Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew\">Renew your passport</a> if you need to.  </p>\n\n<p>You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dual-nationals\">Dual nationals</h3>\n\n<p>Malaysia does not recognise dual nationality. You can be refused entry if you’re found with a Malaysian passport and one of a different nationality. If you have dual nationality (not including Malaysian), enter and exit on the same passport.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"visa-requirements\">Visa requirements</h2>\n\n<p>You can visit Malaysia without a visa for tourism. You will normally be allowed to stay for 90 days on arrival.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to stay for longer than 90 days or are not a tourist, you must apply for a visa from the nearest <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.kln.gov.my/web/guest/overseas-mission\">Malaysian diplomatic mission</a> before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>The Malaysian authorities do not tolerate illegal immigration. Do not overstay your visa or violate the terms of entry. Even if you overstay for just a few days, you can be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>fined</li>\n  <li>detained</li>\n  <li>deported to the UK at your own cost</li>\n  <li>banned  from returning to Malaysia</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Detention facilities can be poor with limited healthcare. The British High Commission is unable to help you stay in Malaysia or issue any document to support your overstay.</p>\n\n<p>Keep a copy of your passport and visa safe in case your passport is lost. It may take time to get a replacement visa. If you cannot show your original visa or entry stamp on exit, you may be treated as an overstayer.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"submitting-an-arrival-card\">Submitting an arrival card</h3>\n\n<p>You must <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://imigresen-online.imi.gov.my/mdac/main\">submit an arrival card online</a> to enter Malaysia. Do this before you travel – airlines may ask for it at check-in. If you are not passing through immigration, you do not need to complete an arrival card. See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://imigresen-online.imi.gov.my/mdac/main\">Malaysian Immigration website</a> for further information, including exemption details.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"entering-east-malaysia\">Entering East Malaysia</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re travelling between Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (sometimes known as Malaysian Borneo and made up of the states of Sabah and Sarawak), you must carry your passport. You will pass through immigration control and must get entry and exit stamps.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccine-requirements\">Vaccine requirements</h2>\n\n<p>To enter Malaysia, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission\">country listed as a transmission risk</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/137/malaysia#Vaccine_Recommendations\">TravelHealthPro’s Malaysia guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"drug-screening\">Drug screening</h2>\n\n<p>The Malaysian authorities could ask you to take a urine test on arrival if they suspect drug use. If they find drugs in your system, they could detain or deport you and ban you from returning to Malaysia. You could face these penalties even if you took the drug outside Malaysia, including in a country where it is legal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.customs.gov.my/en/tp/Pages/tp_ppel.aspx\">goods you can take into or out of Malaysia</a>. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.</p>\n\n<p>If you are not sure if it is legal to bring items, including medications, declare them on entry.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"importing-firearms\">Importing firearms</h3>\n\n<p>It’s illegal to import unlicensed firearms and ammunition into Malaysia. This includes spent ammunition and souvenirs from war museums. Do not take any weapons or replica weapons into Malaysia. You may be detained and charged if you do. If you’re convicted of dealing in illegal firearms, you can get a death sentence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taking-money-into-or-out-of-malaysia\">Taking money into or out of Malaysia</h3>\n\n<p>When you enter or exit Malaysia, you must declare cash in any currency or travellers cheques worth 10,000 US dollars or more. If you do not, customs officials could seize your money. You could get a fine of up to 3 million Malaysian ringgit and up to 5 years in prison.</p>\n\n<p>Before you travel, you must get approval to take ringgit worth 10,000 US dollars or more into or out of Malaysia.  </p>\n\n<p>See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.customs.gov.my/en/tp/Pages/tp_ppel.aspx\">Royal Malaysian Customs Department</a> website for more information.</p>\n\n","slug":"entry-requirements","title":"Entry requirements"},{"body":"<p>This guide also has safety advice for <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/malaysia/regional-risks\">regions of Malaysia</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"terrorism\">Terrorism</h2>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.   </p>\n\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad</a>.   </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorism-in-malaysia\">Terrorism in Malaysia  </h3>\n\n<p>Terrorist attacks in Malaysia cannot be ruled out.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorism attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreign nationals, such as: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>bars and restaurants</li>\n  <li>hotels</li>\n  <li>markets</li>\n  <li>shopping malls</li>\n  <li>tourist attractions</li>\n  <li>places of worship</li>\n  <li>airports</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You should be especially vigilant and maintain a high level of security awareness in crowded places and at large gatherings.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorist-kidnap\">Terrorist kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>In Malaysia, there is a threat to foreigners of kidnapping in coastal areas of eastern Sabah from terrorist groups. The threat is particularly high between the towns of Sandakan and Tawau and on islands close to the Sulu Archipelago in the southern Philippines.</p>\n\n<p>The Abu Sayyaf Group (<abbr title=\"Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG)\">ASG</abbr>), based in the Philippines, has previously kidnapped foreigners from the east coast of mainland Sabah, the islands and the surrounding waters. The group has murdered several hostages. Some groups operating in the southern Philippines, including factions of <abbr title=\"Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG)\">ASG</abbr>, have pledged allegiance to Daesh and are likely to regard westerners as legitimate targets.</p>\n\n<p>British nationals are seen as legitimate targets, including tourists, humanitarian aid workers, journalists and business travellers. If you are kidnapped, the reason for your presence is unlikely to protect you or secure your safe release. </p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners builds the capability of terrorist groups and finances their activities. This can, in turn, increase the risk of further hostage-taking. The Terrorism Act (2000) makes payments to terrorists illegal. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>In response to the current situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, there have been peaceful demonstrations in some Malaysian cities, including outside some western embassies.  </p>\n\n<p>It’s illegal under Malaysian law for foreign nationals to take part in demonstrations or protests.    </p>\n\n<p>Monitor local and international media and avoid all demonstrations. Police can use tear gas and water cannons to control public protests.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-yourself-and-your-belongings\">Protecting yourself and your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Bag-snatching is common, particularly in major cities. Thieves on motorbikes can target tourists. They can cut straps or pull off bags carried on the shoulder closest to the road. They have sometimes pulled people to the ground and killed or injured them if they try to hold onto their bags.</p>\n\n<p>To protect yourself from petty crime, avoid carrying valuables and take particular care of your passport while:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>walking</li>\n  <li>in cafes</li>\n  <li>on aircraft</li>\n  <li>in airport and railway terminals</li>\n  <li>at hotels</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Credit card and ATM fraud is widespread. Take care when using your card.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-security\">Personal security</h3>\n\n<p>There have been assaults and robberies, particularly around bars and nightlife areas. Do not open your hotel room door to strangers, especially late at night. This applies particularly to women travelling alone.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-spiking\">Drink spiking</h3>\n\n<p>There have been cases of strangers offering tourists a spiked drink, even in reputable bars or restaurants, and then robbing or assaulting them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"police-reports\">Police reports</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re a victim of crime, inform the local police and get a police report for insurance purposes.   </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>Malaysia is a multicultural, majority Muslim country. Respect local laws, cultures, traditions and religions.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a Muslim, you may be subject to local Sharia law.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>By law you must carry ID. Always carry your passport.   </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-code\">Dress code</h3>\n\n<p>Dress modestly, particularly in conservative and rural areas. You may be refused entry to places of worship or government offices if you do not have your shoulders and knees covered or are not wearing closed shoes. Check the signs displayed at the entrance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan</h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country. In Malaysia, Ramadan will take place in March 2025.</p>\n\n<p>During this time, you should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes – clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n  <li>be aware of the risks of dehydration and that fasting can cause tiredness, particularly during the later afternoon and early evening</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-penalties\">Illegal drugs penalties</h3>\n\n<p>There are severe penalties for all drug offences, including for amphetamine-type stimulants. If you are detained following a raid on a bar or nightclub, you could have to take a urine test to check for drug use.</p>\n\n<p>Possessing drugs, even in very small quantities, carries severe penalties, including:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>arrest and detention</li>\n  <li>a long jail sentence if charged and convicted</li>\n  <li>a possible whipping</li>\n  <li>a possible death sentence by hanging for drug trafficking</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex sexual acts are illegal in Malaysia under federal law. The Malaysian authorities sometimes carry out raids on LGBT+ spaces and events. Showing affection in public could attract negative responses from other members of the public. Openly LGBT+ safe spaces and support groups exist.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"watersports-and-scuba-diving\">Watersports and scuba diving</h3>\n\n<p>If you rent jet skis or any other type of watersports equipment, make sure adequate safety precautions are in place. Only use licensed operators, insist on training before use and make sure you’re covered by your insurance.</p>\n\n<p>Diving school standards are not always as high as in the UK. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check a dive operator’s credentials</li>\n  <li>make sure safety equipment is available on the boat, particularly oxygen</li>\n  <li>ask about safety precautions, including the ability to transfer divers to a hyperbaric chamber</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you have not had any previous diving experience:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>ask your dive instructor to explain what cover they offer before signing up</li>\n  <li>check what to do if something goes wrong, including how to call for help while at sea</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The diving sites of HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales, which lie in international waters off Kuantan, have been declared ‘protected places’ under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. Only dive there on a ‘look not touch’ basis. Make sure any boat operator you use holds a licence for diving at the wreck site.</p>\n\n<p>See ⁠<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rospa.com/leisure-water-safety/water/advice/watersports-abroad\">watersports safety advice</a> from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (ROSPA). </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Malaysia, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll need both the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1949 international driving permit (<abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> and your UK driving licence to drive in Malaysia. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel. You must buy a new <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr> for each additional year you plan to drive in Malaysia.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re in a road accident, it’s illegal to leave the scene before the police arrive. If a crowd gathers, it may be safer to go directly to the nearest police station instead.</p>\n\n<p>Drivers, particularly motorbike riders, do not always stop at traffic lights or pedestrian crossings.</p>\n\n<p>There have been several fatal bus crashes, particularly on overnight journeys. Choose a reputable operator for your journey.</p>\n\n<p>If you rent a motorbike, it’s illegal not to wear a helmet.</p>\n\n<p>Driving under the influence of alcohol is a serious offence, and the traffic police regularly carry out breath tests. If you are found driving over the legal limit, you may get:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a heavy fine</li>\n  <li>a prison sentence</li>\n  <li>deported</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Road conditions in East Malaysia are not as good as those in Peninsular Malaysia.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-taxis\">Using taxis</h3>\n\n<p>At airports you pay for your taxi with a fixed-price coupon you buy at a counter in the terminal. In other areas, taxis should use a meter.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-and-river-travel\">Sea and river travel</h3>\n\n<p>Some passenger boats have sunk due to overloading and poor maintenance. Take care when travelling by passenger ferry or speedboat. Avoid travelling on vessels that are clearly overloaded or in poor condition. Make sure life jackets are available.</p>\n\n<p>Piracy in South-East Asian waters is an ongoing problem. There have been attacks against ships in and around Malaysian waters, particularly in the Strait of Malacca and the waters between Sabah and the southern Philippines. Be vigilant and take appropriate precautions. Reduce opportunities for theft, establish secure areas on board and report all incidents to the coastal and flag state authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Seasonal storms affect Malaysia.
