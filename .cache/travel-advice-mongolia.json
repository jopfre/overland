You do not need to go in person.</p>\n\n<p>The agency will issue you with a digital residence permit that shows your passport number, address, photograph and fingerprints. Always carry it when you are in Mongolia.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"borders-with-mongolia\">Borders with Mongolia</h2>\n\n<p>Mongolia takes border security very seriously and foreign nationals are not routinely allowed access to border areas. The authorities can regard zones of up to 100km inside the border as a border area. If you wish to travel in these areas, you must get permission from the State Frontier Guard Authority. Only a few specified land border crossings are open to foreigners.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"border-points-open-to-british-citizens\">Border points open to British citizens</h3>\n\n<p>There are normally 8 border points open to British passport holders:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Chinggis Khaan International Airport in Ulaanbaatar</li>\n  <li>Zamin Uud – road and train crossing to China</li>\n  <li>Bulgan – road crossing to China in the west</li>\n  <li>Bichigt – road crossing to China in the south-east</li>\n  <li>Tsagaannuur – road crossing to Russia in the far west</li>\n  <li>Sukhbaatar – train crossing to Russia</li>\n  <li>Altanbulag – road crossing to Russia</li>\n  <li>Ereen-Tsav – road crossing to Russia</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may not cross into China or Russia at other border points, as they are only open to Mongolians, Chinese or Russians.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel by train across the China-Mongolia border, expect a delay of a few hours as the railways use different gauges.</p>\n\n<p>It is difficult to get visas for China or Russia in Mongolia. Ask the Chinese and Russian embassies in London about their visa requirements before travelling to Mongolia.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mongolia-russia-border\">Mongolia-Russia border</h3>\n\n<p>You can only enter Mongolia from Russia on public buses, trains, taxis or private vehicles. All international flights are suspended.</p>\n\n<p>Russian border officials will carefully examine your travel documents.</p>\n\n<p>If you have arrived in Mongolia from Russia and need assistance, call +976 (11) 458 133 and select the option ‘consular services for British nationals’.   </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about goods you can take into or out of Mongolia. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.</p>\n\n<p>If you become involved in a commercial dispute or a criminal investigation about a customs matter, you may be held in Mongolia until it is resolved. Ask to speak to the British Embassy, especially if the authorities say you must accept a travel ban.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bringing-your-vehicle-to-mongolia\">Bringing your vehicle to Mongolia  </h3>\n\n<p>If you plan to enter Mongolia at a land border crossing in your own vehicle, inform the tax authorities and border troops in advance. Contact <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.customs.gov.mn/en/\">Mongolian Customs</a> (in Mongolian). You must complete a customs declaration form. You can do this at the border or at Ulaanbaatar City Customs Office, next to the train station. Make sure you have your driving licence and all the vehicle documents, including ownership records and insurance.</p>\n\n<p>If you do not leave Mongolia in the vehicle you used to enter the country, you must pay customs tax. The amount of tax depends on the vehicle’s engine size and value. For information, see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.customs.gov.mn/en/\">Mongolian Customs</a> (in Mongolian).</p>\n\n<p>If your vehicle breaks down and cannot be fixed, you must pay for it to be transported out of Mongolia or sell it to a local mechanic.</p>\n\n<p>If you sell your broken-down vehicle to a mechanic, you must still pay customs tax when you leave. You must show the customs office evidence you sold the vehicle (proof of sale document, photos, a letter from the mechanic and a police report).</p>\n\n<p>You must not leave your vehicle unattended or abandon it. If you do, Mongolian Customs will contact the British Embassy and send you a fine. If you leave your vehicle in Mongolia, you must pay to store it with a mechanic or at an official customs warehouse. When you leave the country, you must submit a customs declaration form and show your driving licence, car ownership records and proof of valid insurance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taking-money-into-mongolia\">Taking money into Mongolia </h3>\n\n<p>You can take in up to 15 million in Mongolian tugriks. </p>\n\n<p>Declare cash or travellers cheques if the value is 10,000 US dollars or more.
