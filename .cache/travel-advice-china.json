It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities in China set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://gb.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/\">Chinese Embassy in the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Immigration authorities may collect biometric data, including scanned fingerprints and photos, to register your entry into China.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"medical-screening-on-arrival-or-during-your-time-in-china\">Medical screening on arrival or during your time in China</h2>\n\n<p>You may need to pass through medical screening on entry into China. This may be body temperature scanning, or more rarely testing such as throat or nasal swabs or medical examinations. Recent changes to China’s ‘Frontier Health and Quarantine Laws’ means you may be refused entry into China if you do not comply with the screening measures.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passport-validity-requirements\">Passport validity requirements</h2>\n\n<p>To enter China, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive and 2 blank pages for visas and stamping.</p>\n\n<p>Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew\">Renew your passport</a> if you need to.</p>\n\n<p>You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.</p>\n\n<p>If you renew your passport while you are in China, contact your local exit and entry office or call the national immigration service hotline on 12367, before or immediately upon receipt.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"visa-requirements\">Visa requirements</h2>\n\n<p>You must have a visa to visit mainland China.</p>\n\n<p>You can visit Hainan without a visa if you fly directly from an approved country or transit point. Check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://en.hnftp.gov.cn/tips/policy/202003/t20200317_3263796.html\">Hainan Authorities website</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<p>Visa-free transit through China is permitted depending on location.

Officials will take a scan of your fingerprints as part of your application. There are visa application centres in London, Manchester, Belfast and Edinburgh. If you’re aged 13 or under, or 71 or over, you do not have to attend in person.</p>\n\n<p>The Chinese Embassy has further information on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://gb.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/visa/notice/202304/t20230403_11053668.htm\">visa categories and how to apply</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you visit Hong Kong from mainland China and want to return to the mainland, you need a visa that allows you to make a second entry into China.</p>\n\n<p>Check your visa details carefully and do not overstay your visa. The authorities carry out regular checks and may fine, detain and deport you.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to stay in China longer than 6 months, you may need to get a residence permit.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"teaching-visas\">Teaching visas</h3>\n\n<p>Teachers have been detained and deported for working on the wrong visa. It is your responsibility to check you’re working on the correct visa.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"dual-chinese-british-nationality\">Dual Chinese-British nationality</h2>\n\n<p>China does not recognise dual nationality. If you were born in China to a Chinese national parent, you will be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>considered by the Chinese authorities to have Chinese nationality</li>\n  <li>treated as a Chinese citizen, even if you used a British passport to enter China</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you enter China on a Chinese passport or identity card, the British Embassy will not be able to offer you help. If you have formally renounced Chinese citizenship, you should carry clear evidence that you have done so. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nationality-in-china\">guidance on nationality in China</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"working-in-china\">Working in China</h2>\n\n<p>You can only work in China if you have a work visa (Z visa). Tourist and business visas do not allow you to work. You must also hold a valid work permit. The local police regularly carry out checks on companies and schools. If you do not follow Chinese immigration laws, there can be serious penalties, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>imprisonment</li>\n  <li>fines</li>\n  <li>deportation</li>\n  <li>an exit ban, which stops you from leaving China</li>\n  <li>an exclusion order, which stops you from returning</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Before you leave the UK, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.chinese-embassy.org.uk/eng/\">Chinese Embassy in the UK</a> to check Z visa requirements. When submitting your application, and when you receive your work permit, check the details are correct, including the location you’ll be working in. If the details are incorrect – even if your employer or others submitted the application on your behalf – the authorities can detain you, fine you or deport you.       </p>\n\n<p>If you are going to change employer once you’re in China, or change location in China with an existing employer, check with the Chinese authorities whether you need a new visa and work permit before doing so.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccine-requirements\">Vaccine requirements </h2>\n\n<p>To enter China, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission\">country listed as a transmission risk</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For full details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/49/china#Vaccine_Recommendations\">TravelHealthPro’s China guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"registering-with-the-authorities\">Registering with the authorities</h2>\n\n<p>You must register your place of residence with the local Public Security Bureau within 24 hours of arrival. Chinese authorities enforce this rule with regular spot-checks of foreign nationals’ documentation. If you’re staying in a hotel, they will register you when you check in.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://english.customs.gov.cn/statics/88707c1e-aa4e-40ca-a968-bdbdbb565e4f.html\">goods you can take into or out of China</a>.

Stay aware of your surroundings at all times. </p>\n\n<p>UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.counterterrorism.police.uk/safetyadvice/\">staying safe abroad</a> and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/reduce-your-risk-from-terrorism-while-abroad\">how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"terrorism-in-china\">Terrorism in China</h3>\n\n<p>Terrorist attacks in China cannot be ruled out.</p>\n\n<p>Although foreigners have not been specifically targeted, attacks may happen in places visited by foreigners. Take particular care during national holidays and at public transport hubs, and always follow the advice of the local authorities.</p>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n  <h2 id=\"risks-under-chinese-national-security-laws\">Risks under Chinese national security laws</h2>\n\n  <p>Chinese national security laws have broad scope, and you can be arrested without having intended to break the law. See advice in the Laws and cultural differences section below for more information.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation </h2>\n\n<p>China is ruled by a single political party. Though China is open to foreign visitors, be aware of political and cultural sensitivities.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings. The Chinese authorities enforce public order strictly, and you may face arrest, detention and deportation. Foreign journalists have been intimidated, assaulted or detained for trying to report on demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>You may risk becoming a target when there is an anti-foreign feeling or attitude in China. Keep informed of developments and follow the advice of the local authorities. During periods of tension, the authorities may block:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>news reporting</li>\n  <li>access to text-messaging</li>\n  <li>the internet</li>\n  <li>international telephone lines</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Posting, publishing or supporting political statements critical of China or the Chinese authorities could be viewed as illegal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<p>Serious crime against foreign nationals is relatively rare, but incidents can happen. Take care of your belongings at major tourist sites and other busy places, particularly where foreign nationals gather.</p>\n\n<p>Indiscriminate attacks using vehicles as a weapon, and knife attacks, have occurred in public places including at schools, supermarkets and hospitals. Although rare, there have been isolated violent attacks that have impacted foreign nationals.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-spiking-and-sexual-assault\">Drink spiking and sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Do not leave drinks unattended or accept drinks from strangers. Personal attacks and sexual assaults are rare, but they can happen, including through drinks being spiked. Women, travelling alone or with female friends, could be at higher risk.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Beware of scams in popular tourist areas. A common example is the ‘tea tasting’ or ‘massage’ scam. Friendly strangers may invite you to visit a bar, to drink tea or have a massage, and the establishment then demands a large fee. This can be followed by threats, violence or credit card fraud.</p>\n\n<p>Inspect the QR code stickers on rental bicycles carefully before using them. The legitimate barcode can be replaced with a false code, which redirects money to a different account.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"commercial-disputes\">Commercial disputes</h3>\n\n<p>Before entering a commercial contract in China, take legal advice, both in the UK and in China. Contracts agreed in the UK are not always recognised by Chinese courts.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re involved in or connected to a business or civil dispute, the Chinese authorities may impose an exit ban, which means you cannot leave China until the matter is resolved. British nationals have been detained against their will, intimidated and forced to pay money.</p>\n\n<p>Violence is rare, but it can be threatened. Report any threats of violence to the Chinese police.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences </h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>Always carry your passport with you. Police carry out random checks, especially during periods of heightened security and major sporting or political events. They do not accept printed copies. Failure to produce your ID can lead to a fine or detention. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"national-security-laws\">National security laws</h3>\n\n<p><strong>There is a risk of detention for alleged breaking of national security laws</strong></p>\n\n<p>China’s authorities have detained foreign nationals who break national security laws. Both ‘national security’ and ‘national interest’ appear regularly in Chinese legislation and have broad scope. You may be detained without having intended to break the law. Activity that happened outside of mainland China – including online activity – could fall under the scope of mainland legislation. There is a risk of arbitrary detention, including of British nationals. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re detained on grounds of national security, you may be held for up to 6 months before formal arrest and denied legal representation before charges are brought.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"travelling-to-sensitive-areas\">Travelling to sensitive areas</h3>\n\n<p>All foreign nationals travelling to or around ‘sensitive’ areas might attract more attention from the authorities, including when:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>taking photographs</li>\n  <li>engaging with political groups or charities</li>\n  <li>engaging with ethnic minority populations</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sensitivities can change over time and may heighten around particular dates or events.</p>\n\n<p>You may attract additional scrutiny while travelling around mainland China if you’re a current or former employee of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>foreign governments</li>\n  <li>media outlets</li>\n  <li>NGOs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This list is not exhaustive and may change over time. This is particularly relevant when travelling to areas with large ethnic minority populations, including but not limited to Xinjiang. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/regional-risks\">Regional risks</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"religious-activities-and-materials\">Religious activities and materials</h3>\n\n<p>The Chinese authorities formally recognise 5 religions: Buddhism, Catholicism, Islam, Protestantism and Taoism. Only officially registered religious organisations are permitted to carry out religious activities. Even officially registered organisations must observe restrictions on some religious activities, including preaching and distributing religious materials. The Falun Gong movement and others the authorities consider as ‘cults’ are banned in China.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"criminal-proceedings-\">Criminal proceedings      </h3>\n\n<p>Chinese laws and procedures relating to the arrest, detention and trial of criminal suspects are different from in the UK. For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>if you’re detained, only your legal representatives and consular staff from the British Embassy are allowed to visit you until your sentence is passed</li>\n  <li>there is no trial by jury, the presiding judge or judges will reach a verdict and then pass sentence if they find the accused guilty</li>\n  <li>if a case goes to trial, the conviction rate is 99%</li>\n  <li>if an offence does not meet the threshold for criminal proceedings, the police still have the right to sentence someone for up to 15 days administrative detention without trial</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The granting of bail is rare, and the criminal process can often last at least a year before a verdict is passed. If bail is granted the accused will not be permitted to leave China.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re suspected of a crime, the Chinese authorities can stop you from leaving China by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>withholding your passport</li>\n  <li>applying an exit ban</li>\n  <li>detaining you for up to 37 days without charge</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The thresholds for detention and prosecution in China differ from those in Hong Kong.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"exit-bans\">Exit bans</h3>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals can be subject to exit bans. Exit bans can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>be put on people involved in commercial or private disputes to stop them from leaving mainland China</li>\n  <li>relate to investigations into an individual, their family or an employer</li>\n  <li>be used in criminal and civil matters, including business disputes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>An exit ban can last for months or years or until a legal process is complete. You may not be aware you are subject to an exit ban until you try to leave mainland China.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"money\">Money</h3>\n\n<p>Cashless payments through smartphone apps such as WeChat Pay or Alipay are extremely common, especially in major cities.</p>\n\n<p>Outside major cities, credit cards are not always accepted and ATMs are limited. It is not possible to exchange Scottish or Northern Irish banknotes.</p>\n\n<p>Counterfeit banknotes (especially 100 renminbi notes) are common, including from ATMs. Banks will not replace them. Check notes carefully before accepting them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-penalties-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs penalties and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>There are severe penalties for drugs offences in China, including the death penalty. The Chinese authorities randomly test foreign nationals for drugs, including on entry to the country. If you test positive, the Chinese authorities can prosecute you regardless of where or when you took drugs. Police also raid homes. If drugs are found in your property, penalties can be extremely harsh.</p>\n\n<p>The police can raid nightclubs and bars. If you’re in a bar that’s raided, you will be subject to on-the-spot testing and immigration checks. This may involve:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>being kept at the location, or another location, for several hours</li>\n  <li>giving hair and urine samples</li>\n  <li>passport and visa checks</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Testing positive for drugs, or being found in breach of your visa conditions, can lead to heavy fines, detention and deportation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"internet-access\">Internet access</h3>\n\n<p>The Chinese authorities control internet access. Internet access can be limited around key political events and dates. Some services are permanently blocked, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Google</li>\n  <li>Facebook</li>\n  <li>YouTube</li>\n  <li>X</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Other websites may sometimes be blocked. </p>\n\n<p>China’s cybersecurity laws state that online products and services (for example, VPNs) need to be licensed by the Chinese government. See the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.miit.gov.cn/\">Ministry of Industry and Information Technology</a> (in Mandarin). Make sure you stay informed and follow Chinese law.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"building-safety\">Building safety</h3>\n\n<p>Fire protection standards in Chinese accommodation are not always the same as in the UK. You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check fire precautions, including access to fire exits</li>\n  <li>make sure your accommodation has a working fire alarm</li>\n  <li>regularly check fire exits are not blocked</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Make sure your accommodation has a working carbon monoxide alarm. People have died of carbon monoxide poisoning due to incorrectly installed gas equipment. </p>\n\n<p>Energy UK has <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.energy-uk.org.uk/customers/carbon-monoxide/\">advice on how to stay safe and the symptoms to look out for</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"teaching-in-china-\">Teaching in China       </h3>\n\n<p>Thoroughly research the school or university that is hiring you in China and make sure you’re confident they are following the law.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex relationships are legal in China, but public attitudes are less tolerant than in the UK. Showing affection in public may receive negative attention. There’s no Chinese law guaranteeing freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism  </h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"hiking\">Hiking</h2>\n\n<p>Do not hike alone in isolated areas, including on the Great Wall, due to unpredictable weather conditions and the chance of injuries. Even when hiking in a group, leave your itinerary, mobile number and expected time of return at your hotel or with a third party.      </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel </h3>\n\n<p>You must have a Chinese driving licence and valid insurance to drive in China. There are harsh penalties for driving without these, including fines and detention.</p>\n\n<p>Drive with caution in China. Accidents are common due to: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the poor quality of roads</li>\n  <li>high volumes of traffic</li>\n  <li>low driving standards</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you’re involved in a serious traffic accident, call the police. Do not move your vehicle until they arrive but make sure you and your passengers are in a safe place. If there are injuries, you may be held legally responsible for medical costs. You will also be held responsible if you hit a pedestrian. </p>\n\n<p>There are harsh penalties including fines, detention and imprisonment for driving under the influence of alcohol, even at very low levels. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>You must show your passport to buy a ticket and to board a train in China.</p>\n\n<p>Trans-Mongolian Express trains (Beijing-Moscow via Ulaanbaatar) are known for smuggling. Petty theft on overnight trains is common. Search your compartment and lock the cabin door before the train leaves.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Mariners should avoid the disputed territory between China and other countries in the East China Sea and the South China Sea. There have been incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships in the area. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.recaap.org/\">ReCAAP Information Sharing Centre</a> has further information about piracy and armed robbery.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling in unmarked or unmetered taxis, as there have been incidents of sexual assault and robbery against foreign nationals. In marked taxis, make sure someone knows where you are and try to take a note of the taxi’s number.</p>\n\n<p>Disputes over taxi fares can quickly escalate. Any physical altercation could lead to detention regardless of who is to blame. Insist on paying the metered fare and ask for a receipt. The receipt should have the taxi number on it.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>China is in an active seismic zone and can experience major earthquakes.

Check with tour operators or travel agents and other media for information. </p>\n\n<p>Once in Tibet, avoid large public gatherings.

There are allegations that police use lethal force to disperse protests. </p>\n\n<p>The Chinese authorities have a significant security presence throughout Xinjiang, both as a visible demonstration of state control and to respond quickly and harshly to any unexpected demonstrations or outbreaks of violence. </p>\n\n<p>There have been widespread arbitrary arrests and extra-judicial detentions in Xinjiang, mainly affecting the local population, particularly Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities. You may be at increased risk if: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>you’re of Turkic descent</li>\n  <li>you have lived previously in Xinjiang</li>\n  <li>your appearance or practices are perceived to be Muslim</li>\n  <li>you publicly participate in Islamic religious practices</li>\n  <li>you’re a foreign national</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Expect airport-style security measures, including passport and security checks, at shopping centres, markets and parks. You may need to give the security forces your phone number, have your photograph taken and explain why you are travelling.
