You should avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings of people. Keep yourself informed of local developments.</p>\n\n<p>As chair for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for all of 2024, there will be high-level meetings in Vientiane and around Laos throughout the year. These may cause traffic delays, along with a much higher security and police presence. Security will be more proactive around the events and as attendees travel between locations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-yourself-and-your-belongings\">Protecting yourself and your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Petty crime can occur in tourist areas and around ATMs. Try to have someone with you and do not carry your bank cards and cash in the same bag. Keep a copy of your passport somewhere safe.</p>\n\n<p>Travellers regularly report random bag snatches, often by people on motorcycles. Hold your bags on the side away from the road, and do not have valuables on display.</p>\n\n<p>People have reported incidents where they are approached and followed when alone. Be alert to your surroundings, trust your instincts and if you think you’re being followed move to an area where there are other people. Consider sharing your planned route in advance and avoid quiet or less-travelled areas.</p>\n\n<p>Safes in hotels and guesthouses are not necessarily secure. Use your own lock where possible. Take care of your possessions if you’re travelling overnight on public transport.</p>\n\n<p>Be particularly careful travelling at night by bicycle or motorcycle. Stick to well-used, well-lit roads and carry a personal alarm if possible, especially if you’re alone.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"motorcycle-scams\">Motorcycle scams</h3>\n\n<p>Do not leave your passport as a deposit or guarantee when hiring motorcycles. There have been reports of rental companies arranging for their motorcycles to be deliberately stolen or damaged, then keeping passports and demanding high fees. Make sure your travel insurance covers medical and other costs that arise from motorcycle accidents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"reporting-a-crime\">Reporting a crime</h3>\n\n<p>Call the Tourist Police in Vientiane on 021 251 128.</p>\n\n<p>Local law enforcement responses to crimes, even violent crimes, are often limited. Foreigners attempting to report crimes have reported finding police stations closed, emergency telephone numbers unanswered, or police with no transport or authorisation to investigate crimes at night. If the police do attend, they may ask you to pay fuel and telephone costs. Ask the staff at your accommodation for help with reporting a crime.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking\">Drink and food spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Both male and female tourists have reported having their drink or food spiked with drugs and in some cases been assaulted. Never leave food or drink unattended. Be cautious about accepting drinks from strangers at bars, clubs, restaurants and parties.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"methanol-poisoning\">Methanol poisoning</h3>\n\n<p>There have been deaths and cases of serious illness caused by alcoholic drinks containing methanol. Methanol has been used in the manufacture of counterfeit replicas of well-known alcohol brands or illegal local spirits, like vodka. You should take care if offered, particularly for free, or when buying spirit-based drinks. If labels, smell or taste seem wrong then do not drink.</p>\n\n<p>Affected drinks may include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>local spirits, including local rice or palm liquor</li>\n  <li>spirit-based mixed drinks, such as cocktails</li>\n  <li>counterfeit brand-name bottled alcohol in shops or behind the bar</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Laos authorities have issued an order prohibiting the sale and consumption of Tiger Vodka and Tiger Whisky due to concerns about them being a risk to health. You should avoid consuming these products.</p>\n\n<p>To protect yourself from methanol poisoning:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>buy alcoholic beverages only from licensed liquor stores</li>\n  <li>buy drinks only at licensed bars and hotels</li>\n  <li>avoid home-made alcoholic drinks</li>\n  <li>check bottle seals are intact</li>\n  <li>check labels for poor print quality or incorrect spelling</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Methanol is tasteless and odourless. It can rapidly lead to serious illness. Long-term effects may include blindness and permanent damage to the Central Nervous System. Coma and death may occur following substantial exposure.</p>\n\n<p>TravelHealthPro lists the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/25/personal-safety\">symptoms of methanol poisoning</a>. Seek <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/laos-list-of-medical-facilities\">urgent medical attention</a> if you or someone you are travelling with show signs of methanol poisoning.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-the-death-penalty\">Illegal drugs and the death penalty</h3>\n\n<p>The possession and use of all drugs including marijuana are illegal in Laos and penalties are harsh. These include life sentences and the death penalty, with a number of Lao nationals having been sentenced to death in 2024.</p>\n\n<p>For confidential support and guidance for dealing with officials, call the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/world/organisations/british-embassy-vientiane\">British Embassy in Vientiane</a> (24 hours).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Photographing or entering any military site without an official invitation is prohibited and you may be arrested or detained. Avoid photographing bridges or airfields.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"getting-permission-for-special-travel-projects\">Getting permission for special travel projects</h3>\n\n<p>You should get permission from the local district authorities for any travel seen as out of the ordinary, such as extensive photography, or scientific research of any kind.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"relationships-with-lao-nationals\">Relationships with Lao nationals</h3>\n\n<p>The Lao government prohibits sexual relationships between foreign and Lao nationals, except when the parties have been married in accordance with Lao family law. You must ask permission for marriage or engagement to a Lao national in a formal application to the Lao authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Penalties for failing to register such a relationship can be up to 5,000 US dollars fine and possible imprisonment. It is not unknown for Lao authorities to demand entry into hotel rooms or guesthouses where they suspect this regulation is being broken.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking-and-e-cigarette-bans\">Smoking and e-cigarette bans </h3>\n\n<p>While cigarettes are common, the use of e-cigarettes is illegal. You could be fined or imprisoned for importing, selling, purchasing or using them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-codes\">Dress codes</h3>\n\n<p>When you visit any temples and religious sites, your shoulders and knees should be covered, whether you are male or female.</p>\n\n<p>It is not culturally appropriate to walk around in public wearing swimming costumes after leaving waterfalls, rivers or swimming pools.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations in Laos. Proud To Be Us Laos raises awareness about LGBT+ rights and HIV/AIDS among the LGBT+ community.

You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"International driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Police may stop your car at any time, particularly in the evening, and ask for ID. You should stop at checkpoints and roadblocks unless you are waved on. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-conditions\">Driving conditions</h3>\n\n<p>Roads in Laos are in poor condition and vehicles are not maintained to UK standards. Travel after dark significantly increases the risk of an accident, as vehicles often do not have lights. Livestock including water buffalo also stray on to the roads causing accidents.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-accidents-and-safety\">Road accidents and safety</h3>\n\n<p>If you’re involved in a road accident, you will have to pay compensation for third-party property damage and injury, even if you’re not at fault. Generally, the Lao authorities will overwhelmingly find in favour of Lao citizens, regardless of the situation. Lao insurers only meet a small proportion of the costs of an accident and will not cover this compensation.</p>\n\n<p>Motorbike rentals may not supply helmets, so budget to purchase one locally. Take extra care when using public transport or shared vehicles, as they can be overcrowded and unsafe. You can report road accidents to a dedicated police number +856 20 5666 9090.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"china-laos-expressway\">China-Laos Expressway</h3>\n\n<p>The recently opened Vientiane to Vang Vieng section of the China-Laos Expressway is the first contained high-speed road in Laos, with posted speed limits between 80 and 120km/h. Take care when using this road, as some local users will be unfamiliar with this type of carriageway.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"landmines-and-unexploded-weapons\">Landmines and unexploded weapons</h2>\n\n<p>Landmines and other unexploded weapons are a hazard throughout Laos and kill a number of people each year. Keep to main routes in rural areas, and do not pick up metal objects. This risk is higher after flash floods or landslides during the monsoon season.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards</a>. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"monsoon\">Monsoon</h3>\n\n<p>The rainy season in Laos normally runs from May to October, at the same time as the typhoon season in south-east Asia. Mountain areas are vulnerable to landslides in the rainy season and the Mekong’s river basins and surrounding areas are likely to be flooded. Meteorologists predict that tropical storms could be more forceful and more frequent in the future, this can amplify monsoon storms and rainfall. Away from river basins there is a high risk of flash flooding causing falling trees, damage to buildings and transport infrastructure; be aware landslides may expose undiscovered UXO.</p>\n\n<p>The Mekong River Commission posts <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ffw.mrcmekong.org/\">official updates on the Mekong River</a>.
