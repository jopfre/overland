Seek <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-medical-facilities-in-costa-rica\">urgent medical attention</a> if you or someone you are travelling with show signs of methanol poisoning.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences  </h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID </h3>\n\n<p>As a foreigner, you must carry ID such as a passport. The police will usually accept a printed copy. Make sure you have the original available somewhere safe in case they ask to see it. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences </h3>\n\n<p>Do not get involved with drugs of any kind. The Costa Rican authorities treat the possession of drugs and drug trafficking severely. The minimum sentence is 8 years imprisonment. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers </h3>\n\n<p>Costa Rica is generally welcoming of LGBT+ travellers. Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism  </h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-safety\">Swimming safety </h3>\n\n<p>While swimming on any beach in Costa Rica, bear in mind that rip currents are very common and there are often no lifeguards. Seek reliable local advice. Drownings are the second most common cause of accidental death and in recent years have averaged 50 to 60 per year, a third of whom were tourists. </p>\n\n<p>Take extra care if participating in tours involving snorkelling or similar activities. There have been recent fatalities. </p>\n\n<p>There are regular sightings of crocodiles along the Pacific coast near beaches popular with surfers, from Playa Azul down to Playa Esterillos, and there have been attacks in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>See <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rlss.org.uk/safety-on-holiday\">water safety on holiday</a> from the Royal Life Saving Society.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"water-sports\">Water sports </h3>\n\n<p>Safety standards for adventure activities and on small boats are variable. There have been several incidents involving small boats in the Tortuguero area, including a fatality due to a falling tree. If you plan to take part any of these activities, use an established company with experienced staff.</p>\n\n<p>See ⁠<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rospa.com/leisure-water-safety/water/advice/watersports-abroad\">watersports safety advice</a> from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (ROSPA).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rainforest-toursand-adventure-tourism\">Rainforest tours and Adventure Tourism. </h3>\n\n<p>If you are visiting jungle areas, go with an experienced local guide. Make sure you get appropriate insurance that covers you for all the activities you want to do. This includes activities such as quad biking, surfing, rock-climbing and zip-lining which can be hazardous but are frequently excluded from general travel insurance policies.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks-\">Transport risks  </h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel  </h3>\n\n<p>If you’re planning to drive in Costa Rica, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Private cars are only allowed to enter the capital of San José on certain weekdays, allocated using the last digit of the licence plate number. Your hire car company can give you more details. </p>\n\n<p>You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Costa Rica for up to 180 days,  depending on the length of stay you have been granted as a Tourist.</p>\n\n<p>If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence\">update it to a photocard licence</a> or get an  <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">international driving permit</a>. Border authorities may refuse entry to right-hand drive vehicles as they’re illegal and do not qualify for local insurance.</p>\n\n<p>The standard of driving is lower than in the UK. Drivers cause accidents by speeding, overtaking irresponsibly or ignoring traffic lights. Take care when approaching bridges over the road as these often narrow the road to a single lane. </p>\n\n<p>Road conditions are generally good on main routes. However, in the rainy season, heavy rains can cause potholes and landslides that block the roads.  </p>\n\n<p>If you have an accident where somebody has been injured or where the other driver does not accept blame, you must not move your vehicle until the traffic police have arrived. Contact the traffic police (‘transito’ – telephone: 2222 9330 or 2222 9245) and the insurance investigator (INS – telephone: 800 800 8000) immediately.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis </h3>\n\n<p>Avoid using unofficial taxis (‘taxi piratas’). Official taxis are red (or orange at the airport) with a triangular sticker and plastic box on the roof with the name and number of the taxi company. It’s best to use radio-dispatched taxis. Make sure the driver’s ID is clearly visible on the dashboard and that the driver uses the meter.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"airport-disruptions\">Airport disruptions</h3>\n\n<p>Services at the Liberia Airport (LIR – Daniel Oduber International) in Guanacaste have been subject to interruptions. You should monitor carefully information from your travel provider when travelling to and from this airport.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters </h2>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a> for information about how to prepare, and how to react if there is a warning. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hurricanes\">Hurricanes  </h3>\n\n<p>The hurricane season usually runs from June to November – the same as the hurricane season in the Caribbean. Monitor the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\">National Hurricane Center</a> forecasts and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://severeweather.wmo.int/tc/cgn/index.html\">World Meteorological Organization warnings</a>. Follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders. Keep up to date with <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office \">FCDO</abbr> travel advice and social media. Plan any local travel carefully.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding  </h3>\n\n<p>The June-November period is also the peak rainy season. Flooding and landslides may occur, resulting in road closures and driving hazards.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes </h3>\n\n<p>There is a risk of earthquakes: movements greater than magnitude 6 occur periodically. Local infrastructure is well-prepared, and earthquakes seldom have widespread effects. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency website has advice about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a> or a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/tsunamis\">tsunami</a>. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"volcanic-eruptions\">Volcanic eruptions </h3>\n\n<p>Costa Rica has 16 volcanoes, several of which are considered active. The risk of eruptions is always present. The most recent significant eruption was at Volcan Rincon de la Vieja on 21 April 2023. </p>\n\n<p>Check news reports and follow local advice before travelling to any areas around volcanoes. Avoid volcanic areas during and immediately after heavy rainfall when there’s increased risk of lava flows.</p>\n\n<p>Ash plumes can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ivhhn.org/\">affect air quality and have an impact on health</a>. If you have any pre-existing respiratory conditions, you might be at increased risk of triggering or worsening your symptoms. A properly fitted face mask may provide some protection.  </p>\n\n","slug":"safety-and-security","title":"Safety and security"},{"body":"<p>Before you travel check that: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>your destination can provide the healthcare you may need </li>\n  <li>you have <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foreign-travel-insurance\">appropriate travel insurance</a> for local treatment or unexpected medical evacuation </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is particularly important if you have a health condition or are pregnant.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"emergency-medical-number\">Emergency medical number </h2>\n\n<p>Call 911 and ask for an ambulance. </p>\n\n<p>Contact your insurance company quickly if you’re referred to a medical facility for treatment.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccine-recommendations-and-health-risks\">Vaccine recommendations and health risks </h2>\n\n<p>To enter Costa Rica, you must have a certificate to prove you’ve had a yellow fever vaccination if you’re coming from a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://nathnacyfzone.org.uk/factsheet/65/countries-with-risk-of-yellow-fever-transmission\">country listed as a transmission risk</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/58/costa-rica#Vaccine_Recommendations\">TravelHealthPro’s Costa Rica guide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>See what health risks you’ll face in Costa Rica, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>malaria</li>\n  <li>dengue</li>\n  <li>Zika Virus</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"medication\">Medication </h2>\n\n<p>Prescriptions from the UK cannot be used locally.
