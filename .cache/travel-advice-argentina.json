Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.   </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"political-protests\">Political protests</h3>\n\n<p>Political demonstrations and picketing are more common in Argentina than in the UK. Some demonstrations attract large numbers of people, and they can occasionally turn violent. Demonstrations are particularly common near Congress (‘Congreso’) and the Presidential Palace (‘Casa Rosada’).</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid all protests, demonstrations and marches</li>\n  <li>exercise normal caution at any large gathering</li>\n  <li>be aware of your surroundings</li>\n  <li>monitor the local news</li>\n  <li>follow the advice of local authorities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There have also been occasional Falklands-related protests, including outside the British Embassy and British-affiliated businesses in Argentina.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"demonstrations\">Demonstrations</h3>\n\n<p>Groups of demonstrators (‘piqueteros’) sometimes block major roads at times of social unrest. These can include the major routes into and out of Buenos Aires City. This can cause significant delays.</p>\n\n<p>When planning to travel:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>monitor the local news</li>\n  <li>do not attempt to cross blockades</li>\n  <li>follow the advice of local authorities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Thieves and pickpockets operate on public transport and at bus and train terminals.</p>\n\n<p>To reduce the risk of theft:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>always keep a close eye on your personal possessions – do not hang bags on the back of seats</li>\n  <li>carry cash out of sight or close to you – a money belt under your clothes is the safest option</li>\n  <li>you may need to produce your passport when paying with a credit card, but keep a copy somewhere safe</li>\n  <li>keep your bags close while you are checking into a hotel or hostel – thieves posing as hotel guests can snatch them</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thefts from unattended vehicles, especially hire cars, are also common. This happens frequently in Bariloche, but can happen across the country.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"street-crime-and-scams\">Street crime and scams</h3>\n\n<p>In crowded places, thieves can cut handbags open. They can snatch a mobile phone while you are using it on the street. Thieves on motorbikes can snatch bags from pedestrians.</p>\n\n<p>Thieves – often women – use distraction techniques and may work in teams of 2 or more. A common form of distraction theft reported in Buenos Aires is the ‘mustard scam’. Thieves take your bags while an accomplice pretends to help you remove mustard they have sprayed on you. If this happens to you, politely but firmly refuse help and walk away.</p>\n\n<p>In Buenos Aires, be particularly cautious in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Palermo</li>\n  <li>San Telmo Market and general area of San Telmo</li>\n  <li>La Boca</li>\n  <li>The Ecological Reserve</li>\n  <li>Retiro</li>\n  <li>Florida Street</li>\n  <li>9 de Julio</li>\n  <li>Avenida de Mayo</li>\n  <li>Avenida Rivadavia near the obelisk</li>\n  <li>Retiro Bus terminal</li>\n  <li>Cruise and ferry terminals</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In Mendoza, be particularly cautious downtown.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"violent-crime\">Violent crime</h3>\n\n<p>Armed robberies are a risk. If you are the victim of a robbery, hand over your cash and valuables without resistance.</p>\n\n<p>Be especially vigilant in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>La Boca, Buenos Aires – avoid the streets outside the Caminito tourist area and stay in the designated tourist area where there are high-visibility police patrols</li>\n  <li>Rosario, Province of Santa Fe</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"criminal-kidnapping\">Criminal kidnapping</h3>\n\n<p>Kidnappings including ‘express kidnappings’ – short-term opportunistic abductions – occasionally happen in Argentina. Victims of express kidnap are held and forced to empty their bank accounts by making bank transfers or going to ATMs, after which they are normally quickly released. Be aware of your surroundings and always let someone you trust know your whereabouts. If you are a victim of kidnapping, follow the kidnapper’s instructions.</p>\n\n<p>To reduce your risk:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>avoid wearing expensive clothing or jewellery, particularly in public</li>\n  <li>avoid casual taxis – see <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/argentina/safety-and-security#transport-risks\">Transport risks</a>\n</li>\n  <li>be vigilant, especially at night</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking-and-scams\">Drink and food spiking and scams</h3>\n\n<p>Drinks and food can be spiked and could put you at risk of robbery or assault. Do not leave drinks unattended in bars and restaurants and do not accept food or drink from strangers.</p>\n\n<p>Be alert to the possible use of ‘date rape’ and other drugs. Alcohol and drugs can reduce your vigilance, making you less in control.</p>\n\n<p>There have been reports of foreign tourists being robbed or assaulted after inviting into their accommodation someone they have recently met, online or in person.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Do not become involved with illegal drugs of any kind. Possession of even very small quantities can lead to a lengthy prison sentence.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Argentine society is open and diverse. Discrimination based on sexual orientation is rare. Same-sex marriage is legal.

If you’re travelling to Argentina and think you may be affected by this type of legal action, seek independent legal advice. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"surrogacy\">Surrogacy</h3>\n\n<p>Before you consider a surrogacy arrangement in Argentina, consider the challenges and risks involved, and make sure you seek specialist independent legal advice both in the UK and in Argentina. For more information, read <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> guidance on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/surrogacy-overseas\">surrogacy overseas</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Surrogacy is not regulated by law in Argentina and surrogacy arrangements are not enforceable in law.</p>\n\n<p>Local authorities may consider surrogacy arrangements to be illegal. Criminal investigations into surrogacy agencies and associated service providers are ongoing. Some intended parents have faced issues obtaining birth certificates and when attempting to leave Argentina with the child born to them through surrogacy. </p>\n\n<p>Children born through surrogacy in Argentina are Argentine citizens and must leave the country on an Argentine passport. They are also subject to local regulations applicable to the exit of minors in Argentina.
