There has been widespread violence involving the deaths of thousands of civilians and fighting continues across much of the country.</p>\n\n<p>The military are highly likely to target all opposition-controlled areas, including with airstrikes. Meanwhile, opposition groups are likely to target the following facilities in military-regime controlled towns and cities, including with small explosives:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>military and government buildings and check points</li>\n  <li>police stations</li>\n  <li>ward administrators’ offices</li>\n  <li>businesses, hotels and restaurants linked to the military, or seen as such</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There have also been attacks on schools and hospitals.</p>\n\n<p>There is a higher likelihood of opposition attacks after sunset and an increased presence of security forces on occasions of national significance, including:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Myanmar Independence Day (4 January )</li>\n  <li>the anniversary of the 2021 coup (1 February)</li>\n  <li>Union Day (12 February)</li>\n  <li>Peasants Day (2 March)</li>\n  <li>Armed Forces Day (27 March)</li>\n  <li>Thingyan Festival (mid-April)</li>\n  <li>Martyrs’ Day (19 July)</li>\n  <li>the anniversary of the execution of political prisoners (23 to 25 July)</li>\n  <li>the lapsing of the state of emergency (1 August)</li>\n  <li>the 8888 uprising (8 August )</li>\n  <li>National Day (25 November)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some areas in Myanmar are under martial law; others have curfews or ‘stay at home’ orders.

Make sure you have access to your cash, but avoid displaying it or other valuables in public.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Thieves often distract their victims by asking questions, begging for money, offering items for sale, or simply bumping or jostling. Take extra care of your belongings and be wary of strangers who approach you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Be wary of merchants offering to sell gems, gold or semi-precious stones. You could lose your money or get drawn into an illegal activity. Do not buy gems or minerals from an unlicensed source.</p>\n\n<p>Be cautious of job offers that appear too good to be true in Myanmar and neighbouring countries. There are cyber scam centres operating in eastern Myanmar, particularly in the Myawaddy district in eastern Kayin and Tachileik township in eastern Shan. Victims are trafficked into Myanmar to carry out online scams. They are held in poor living conditions and subjected to severe mistreatment. Some victims have had their passports confiscated and have been held to ransom.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office\">FCDO</abbr> is aware of fraudulent emails being sent by individuals claiming to work for British firms seeking loans to advance their business interests in Myanmar. These have falsely stated they are acting on the advice of the British Embassy.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"landmines\">Landmines</h2>\n\n<p>The risk of landmines in rural areas is serious, particularly in northern and central Rakhine, northern Shan and Kachin states. There is evidence of landmine use having spread to other areas since the coup in 2021. Some areas with known mines are marked by signs, but this practice is not widespread. Be extremely cautious if you must leave the main roads in these areas.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mobile-phones-and-internet\">Mobile phones and internet</h2>\n\n<p>Mobile phone network coverage is good in urban areas and some rural areas but can be subject to disruption as the Myanmar authorities have influence over the mobile telecommunications networks. Foreign mobile phone SIM cards do not reliably work in Myanmar.</p>\n\n<p>Internet service is generally good and wifi is widely available in Yangon, for example in hotels or malls. However, the Myanmar authorities control internet access, and periodically cut off access entirely. Some services are blocked (including Facebook and WhatsApp) and are inaccessible without Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).</p>\n\n<p>Visitors can buy a SIM card for a nominal fee when they arrive. They can be topped up as needed, with top up cards readily available from places like kiosks or supermarkets.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"detention-and-arrest\">Detention and arrest</h3>\n\n<p>There is a risk of arbitrary detention and arrest, particularly for journalists and human rights activists. The criminal justice process followed in such cases falls below international standards.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar does not recognise dual nationality. If you are a dual national with Myanmar nationality you will be treated as a Myanmar national by local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>In February 2024, Myanmar authorities announced that Myanmar men and women could be required, by law, to serve in the armed forces, and has since started conscription. Length of service can depend on criteria such as age, occupation, and whether there is a state of emergency in place. If you are a British-Myanmar dual national, holding a British passport may not exempt you from this law, as Myanmar does not recognise dual nationality.</p>\n\n<p>Myanmar’s defamation laws give broad scope for individuals to bring arbitrary charges, which could result in criminal penalties, including a prison sentence. Foreigners have been subject to criminal investigations for acts such as posting a critical review of a hotel online.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re arrested and convicted of a crime in Myanmar, you can expect a long prison sentence. Conditions in detention are extremely poor. Pre-trial detention can also last many months.</p>\n\n<p>The legal process in Myanmar is unpredictable, lacks transparency and is open to interference from powerful political and business interests. The investigation and trial process falls far below the standard expected in the UK. There are limits to the assistance the British Embassy can offer to those with concerns about the fairness of their trial, as we are unable to interfere in the legal processes of a host country.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"religious-customs\">Religious customs</h3>\n\n<p>When visiting Buddhist religious sites, respect religious customs. Shorts and sleeveless tops will cause offence. You should remove shoes and socks before entering a pagoda or monastery.</p>\n\n<p>Under Myanmar law, insulting religion is a prosecutable offence. Insulting religion is a broad term and can include any disrespectful depiction or image of Buddha or other religious representation. This includes tattoos of Buddha.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs\">Illegal drugs</h3>\n\n<p>Penalties for drug trafficking include a prison sentence of a minimum 15 years or even the death penalty.</p>\n\n<p>For possession of illegal drugs in Myanmar, you could get a fine and a prison sentence of a minimum 5 years to a maximum of 10 years, regardless of the quantity of drugs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taking-photos-and-using-drones\">Taking photos and using drones</h3>\n\n<p>Do not take photographs or videos of the police, demonstrations, military installations or military personnel.</p>\n\n<p>There are strict regulations around bringing in and using drones in Myanmar. Using a drone around government buildings, religious buildings or even tourist sites can result in criminal penalties, including a possible prison sentence. If you want to bring and use a drone in Myanmar, get permission from the Myanmar authorities.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Myanmar for men and women, although in practice these laws are not consistently enforced. If convicted, the punishment can be up to life imprisonment. There have been reports of police using threats of prosecution to extort bribes. This is alleged to include arbitrary arrest and detention.</p>\n\n<p>Public attitudes towards LGBT+ people can be mixed. Up until recently, there have been increasingly large Pride festivals and growing visibility of the LGBT+ community, including gay bars and clubs. However, this has reduced since the coup. Public displays of affection, whether heterosexual or LGBT+, are frowned upon in Myanmar culture.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildlife-animal-products-and-souvenirs\">Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs</h3>\n\n<p>Myanmar is a party to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Over 800 species of animals and plants are banned from international trade and a further 30,000 are strictly controlled by legislation. The restrictions cover some exotic souvenirs, such as those made from turtle shell.</p>\n\n<p>Local authorities have a particular interest in and are monitoring the importation, exportation, possession, acquisition and trading of gold, gems and jewellery. You risk arrest for doing so. Make sure you check with relevant government agencies, and obtain necessary import and export permits before entering or leaving Myanmar.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Myanmar, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The permits and licences you need for driving in Myanmar may change at short notice. Contact your car hire company to find out the latest requirements before you travel. At a minimum, you should carry both the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1969 international driving permit (<abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr>)</a> and your UK driving licence. You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel .</p>\n\n<p>Overland travel can be hazardous, particularly in the rainy season from May to October. Roads can become impassable and bridges are sometimes damaged. Travel by road can be restricted at short notice by military and opposition forces.</p>\n\n<p>Road safety standards are significantly lower than in the UK. Serious road accidents are common. Under Myanmar law, the driver of a car involved in an accident with a pedestrian is always at fault.</p>\n\n<p>Many vehicles, including taxis and buses, are in a poor condition. Although driving is on the right in Myanmar, the majority of cars are right-hand drive.</p>\n\n<p>There are recent reports of attacks on the Yangon-Mandalay Expressway and National Highway 1 that links Yangon to Mandalay . Attacks have included the use of landmines and improvised explosive devices. There is an increased risk of attacks after dark, and an unofficial curfew is in place.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Railway safety standards are significantly below those in the UK. Some rail routes are still operating, but timetables are unreliable. Get information from the closest railway station before travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-and-river-travel\">Sea and river travel</h3>\n\n<p>River transport may not meet internationally recognised safety standards and search and rescue facilities are limited.</p>\n\n<p>During the monsoon season from May to October, heavy rains can cause flooding. Make sure life jackets are available if you travel by boat or ferry, and check local weather conditions before undertaking a river journey.</p>\n\n<p>Get local advice about where it is safe to swim or dive. Bathing in fresh water carries a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.travelhealthpro.org.uk/disease/159/schistosomiasis\">risk of catching schistosomiasis</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cyclones\">Cyclones</h3>\n\n<p>Myanmar normally experiences cyclones between mid-April and mid-May, and during October and November. You can monitor the progress of tropical cyclones on the website of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://severeweather.wmo.int/\">World Meteorological Organization</a>. Floods and landslides may occur. Check local weather reports before travelling, particularly in coastal areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>There is a risk of earthquakes and tremors. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a> or <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/tsunamis\">tsunami</a>.  </p>\n\n","slug":"safety-and-security","title":"Safety and security"},{"body":"<p>This section has safety advice for regions of Myanmar.

Violence is severe and the situation is unpredictable in most ethnic states and border areas.</p>\n\n<p>The Myanmar authorities restrict travel to most border areas.

Attacks may affect civilians and bystanders, including in areas regularly frequented by foreign nationals. This may include hotels, restaurants and accommodation complexes. Military installations, such as checkpoints, are also targets.</p>\n\n<p>A curfew is in place from 1am-3am across Yangon city.</p>\n\n<p>If you encounter a threatening or intimidating situation, do not try to make your way through it.
