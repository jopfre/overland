Indonesian authorities report multiple arrests of alleged terrorists in the advanced stages of preparation.</p>\n\n<p>Indonesian government and law enforcement interests and places of worship are regularly targeted by extremists. Western interests are also at risk. Small-scale attacks occur on a regular basis and further incidents are likely. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreign nationals. Potential targets include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>beach resorts</li>\n  <li>hotels, bars and restaurants</li>\n  <li>markets and shopping malls hosting major international brand outlets</li>\n  <li>tourist attractions</li>\n  <li>places of worship</li>\n  <li>foreign embassies</li>\n  <li>polling stations</li>\n  <li>ferry terminals and airports</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There’s a heightened risk on and around:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Christmas, New Year and Easter</li>\n  <li>Chinese New Year</li>\n  <li>Nyepi (Balinese New Year)</li>\n  <li>Islamic celebrations and holidays such as Ramadan</li>\n  <li>national and local elections</li>\n  <li>presidential inaugurations</li>\n  <li>Independence Day (17 August)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Follow the advice of the local authorities, and stay alert in crowded places and at large gatherings.</p>\n\n<p>Recent attacks include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>in 2022, a suicide bomber attacked a police post on Jalan Astana Anyar, in Bandung, West Java, killing one and injuring 8 people</li>\n  <li>in 2021, there was a suicide attack outside the Catholic Cathedral Church at JaIan Kajaolalido, Makassar</li>\n  <li>in 2020, a police officer was killed and another injured during an attack on a police station in Kalimantan</li>\n  <li>in 2019, a suicide bomber attacked police headquarters in Medan, Sumatra, injuring 4 police officers and 2 civilians</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>The political situation in Indonesia is stable. However, elections, presidential inaugurations and external developments, including in the Middle East, can trigger protests or unrest. Nationwide student protests took place in 2019 and 2020, and could recur at any time.</p>\n\n<p>Indonesia held national elections on 14 February.  </p>\n\n<p>Avoid all protests, demonstrations and student and political rallies as they can become violent without warning.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Reported cases of rape and sexual assault are high in Bali and Lombok. Be alert when out at night, and avoid areas that are poorly lit.</p>\n\n<p>If you call a taxi, use only registered companies, such as Bluebird, Silverbird or Express, and check the driver’s identity. If you book with a mobile app, check the driver is the same as the person on the app, and share your journey with a friend using the app. Be wary of drivers claiming to be registered with app companies and trying to pick up passengers on the street.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-spiking\">Drink spiking</h3>\n\n<p>There have been reports of drink spiking linked to sexual assault in Bali, Lombok and the Gili Islands.</p>\n\n<p>Watch your drinks being prepared, and do not leave them unattended. Do not accept drinks from strangers at clubs or parties.</p>\n\n<p>Tourists have been assaulted or robbed after taking visitors to their hotel rooms, and in some cases have found that their drinks were spiked.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Be aware of the risk of street crime such as bag-snatching and pickpocketing, particularly in busy tourist areas. There are often reports of bag-snatching in Bali. Conceal your bag as much as possible to reduce the risk. Carry only essential items and take care of your passport and bank cards.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of thieves on public transport and at transport hubs. If you’re travelling by car, keep doors locked while driving.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scams\">Scams</h3>\n\n<p>Credit card fraud is common. Do not lose sight of your card during transactions. Criminals sometimes place a fake telephone number on ATMs advising customers to report problems so they can fraudulently ask for card details.</p>\n\n<p>Unlicensed money changers may short-change you. Only use licensed currency exchanges, identified by a Bank of Indonesia logo and a QR code. Open the code to check the name of the business and its operating licence.</p>\n\n<p>There has been a rise in the number of scams at tattoo parlours, nail salons and spas in Bali. Take care when choosing your provider and agree fees in advance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcoholic-drinks-and-drugs\">Alcoholic drinks and drugs</h3>\n\n<p>Drinks served in bars can be stronger than those in the UK, usually because the measures of spirits are larger. In some cases, over-drinking and taking drugs has resulted in accidents, injuries, robbery, assaults and lost travel documents. Some British nationals have suffered psychiatric problems caused by alcohol, drugs and a lack of sleep. Drink responsibly and be aware of your limits.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"methanol-poisoning-\">Methanol poisoning   </h3>\n\n<p>People, including British nationals, have died or suffered serious illness in Indonesia after drinking spirits that contain methanol due to inadequate distillation.</p>\n\n<p>Methanol poisoning cases have resulted from drinks purchased in bars, shops and hotels in tourist areas like Bali, Lombok, the Gili Islands and Sumatra. Criminal gangs make counterfeit replicas of well-known alcohol brands and these could contain high amounts of methanol.</p>\n\n<p>Affected drinks have included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>local spirits, including arak/arrack (a local rice or palm liquor)</li>\n  <li>spirit-based mixed drinks, such as cocktails</li>\n  <li>counterfeit brand-name bottled alcohol in shops or behind the bar</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To protect yourself from methanol poisoning:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>buy alcoholic beverages only from licensed liquor stores</li>\n  <li>buy drinks only at licensed bars and hotels</li>\n  <li>avoid home-made alcoholic drinks</li>\n  <li>check bottle seals are intact</li>\n  <li>check labels for poor print quality or incorrect spelling</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Methanol is tasteless and odourless.

The dates vary by year and country. Ramadan in Indonesia is from 1 March to 29 March 2025. During this time, do not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>eat, drink, smoke or chew gum in public in the daytime, including in your car</li>\n  <li>play loud music or dance</li>\n  <li>swear in public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Get more advice when you arrive from your tour guide, hotel or business contacts.</p>\n\n<p>You should also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>check opening hours of shops and restaurants</li>\n  <li>be aware that if hotels and restaurants are providing food or drink in fasting hours, they may separate you from Islamic guests, for example with screens</li>\n  <li>follow local dress codes – clothing that does not meet local dress codes may cause more offence at this time</li>\n  <li>be aware that driving may be erratic, particularly when people are trying to get home at dusk</li>\n  <li>be patient and show tolerance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"balinese-new-year\">Balinese New Year</h3>\n\n<p>During Balinese New Year (‘Nyepi’), local custom requires that all people in Bali observe a day of silence by staying indoors, turning off lights, and making no noise. Ngurah Rai International Airport is closed for the entire day. However, emergency services and hospitals are allowed to operate.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You must always carry your passport or stay permit (such as KITAS or KITAP).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>Do not get involved with illegal drugs. Possession, trafficking and manufacture of any illegal drugs are serious offences in Indonesia. The Indonesian authorities have a zero-tolerance policy and those caught face lengthy prison sentences or a death penalty, usually after a protracted and expensive legal process. British nationals have been caught and given prison sentences for drug offences in Indonesia.</p>\n\n<p>Police often raid venues (particularly in Bali) known to be frequented by foreigners. You may have to take a urine or blood test if there is a reasonable suspicion that drugs have been used. Criminal gangs in the UK and elsewhere are known to coerce people into carrying drugs across borders. Do not allow yourself to be persuaded.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>The province of Aceh enforces Sharia law. It is the only province in Indonesia to do so and the laws apply to both Muslims and non-Muslims.</p>\n\n<p>In Aceh, the consumption, production and distribution of alcohol are all illegal under Sharia law. Punishment following a Sharia court process is public caning.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex sexual activity is illegal in the province of Aceh under Sharia law.

You can drive using an International Driving Permit (IDP) issued by the UK.  UK nationals who live in Indonesia and have a limited stay permit card (KITAS) can apply for an Indonesian national driving licence.</p>\n\n<p>Before driving, riding or hiring any type of vehicle, ensure that you have the appropriate licence to do so. Check you are covered with your travel insurance company.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-conditions\">Driving conditions</h3>\n\n<p>Traffic discipline is very poor and there has been a large increase in moped and motorbike accidents – some fatal – in Bali. Wear a helmet in good condition if you’re riding a motorbike or moped.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign nationals involved in even minor traffic violations or accidents may be vulnerable to extortion. Some multinational companies do not allow their expatriate staff to drive in Indonesia. Consider employing a private driver or hiring a car with a driver. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re involved in an accident, you must wait for the police at the scene. If you have concerns for your safety, move to another location. Make sure someone stays to watch your vehicle if it will not drive. Report the accident at a police station and show full co-operation. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Travelling by boat or ferry can be dangerous as the sea conditions can change rapidly. Safety standards vary between providers. Vessels can be crowded and overloaded and are often poorly maintained.</p>\n\n<p>Before you travel, check the availability of safety equipment such as life jackets and lifeboats. Life jackets suitable for children are not always available so you may need to bring your own. Avoid travelling after dark unless you’re satisfied the vessel is suitably equipped.</p>\n\n<p>There is a high level of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">piracy and armed robbery against ships</a> in and around the Sulu and Celebes seas and in the Malacca Straits. </p>\n\n<p>Mariners should be vigilant, set up secure areas on board and report all incidents to the coastal and flag state authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"volcanic-eruptions\">Volcanic eruptions</h3>\n\n<p>Check <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/indonesia/regional-risks\">Regional risks</a> for warnings against travel to specific volcanoes.</p>\n\n<p>There are lots of active volcanoes in Indonesia.

Volcanic ash may fall outside exclusion zones.</p>\n\n<p>Ash clouds can affect flight schedules and the operation of regional airports. Check with your airline or travel company for the latest information.</p>\n\n<p>Ash plumes and pollutants from volcanoes can affect air quality and have an impact on health. A fitted face mask may provide some protection from airborne particles. To reduce exposure to hazardous gases, stay inside and close doors and windows. Masks will be available in Indonesia – or buy your own before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>If you have any pre-existing respiratory conditions, such as asthma, you might be at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/factsheet/102/volcanoes\">increased risk of triggering or worsening your symptoms</a>.

Cities, especially Jakarta, can suffer severe localised flooding resulting in major traffic congestion and power outages. The main toll road to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport and other major roads in Jakarta can be affected by flooding. There are landslides in mountainous and remote areas, but also in some urban areas. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes-and-tsunamis\">Earthquakes and tsunamis</h3>\n\n<p>Earthquakes happen regularly.
