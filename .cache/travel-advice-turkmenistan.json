It is based on the UK government’s understanding of Turkmenistan’s current rules for the most common types of travel.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities in Turkmenistan set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the  <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://uk.tmembassy.gov.tm/en\">Embassy of Turkmenistan in the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"covid-19-rules\">COVID-19 rules</h2>\n\n<p>While Turkmenistan doesn’t require COVID-19 vaccination, all travellers must undergo a COVID-19 test upon arrival, which costs about 31 US dollars.</p>\n\n<p>Confirm the latest requirements with your Turkmen sponsor, or with the embassy that issued your visa if you have one. Check with your travel company or airline for changes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passport-validity-requirements\">Passport validity requirements</h2>\n\n<p>To enter Turkmenistan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you plan to leave Turkmenistan.</p>\n\n<p>Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew\">Renew your passport</a> if you need to.</p>\n\n<p>You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"visa-requirements\">Visa requirements</h2>\n\n<p>You must have a visa to visit Turkmenistan.</p>\n\n<p>If you have the wrong visa or if you overstay your visa, you could be prosecuted and possibly imprisoned.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"applying-for-a-visa\">Applying for a visa</h3>\n\n<p>Contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://uk.tmembassy.gov.tm/en\">Embassy of Turkmenistan in London</a> at least a month ahead of your intended travel date.</p>\n\n<p>You need a letter of invitation to support your application. For tourist visits, authorised travel agents can provide these letters.  If you are travelling on business, you will need letters from the relevant government ministries or companies you want to do business with. If you want to attend an exhibition or event, the organiser normally provides visa support.</p>\n\n<p>You should keep your letter of invitation with you when you are in Turkmenistan.</p>\n\n<p>The Embassy of Turkmenistan will refer your visa application to Ashgabat for a decision, which can take up to a month. There is an accelerated 24-hour service costing about 150 US dollars.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"transit-visas-and-travelling-through-turkmenistan-by-car\">Transit visas and travelling through Turkmenistan by car</h3>\n\n<p>You can use a transit visa if you will be in Turkmenistan for less than 5 days. You cannot change your transit visa to a tourist visa, and you must notify the authorities if you intend to change your route.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot buy a transit visa at Baku seaport. If you want to travel to Azerbaijan by sea, you need to have visas for both Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll be charged up to 150 US dollars to bring a car into Turkmenistan by land or sea.</p>\n\n<p>Border officials may close Turkmen border crossings without notice.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vaccine-requirements\">Vaccine requirements</h2>\n\n<p>For details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/country/228/turkmenistan#Vaccine_Recommendations\">TravelHealthPro’s Turkmenistan guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"registering-with-the-authorities\">Registering with the authorities</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re staying for more than 3 days, you must register with the State Migration Service of Turkmenistan within 3 days of your arrival. Your hotel will usually register you, but if you are staying in private accommodation you’ll need to go and register in person.</p>\n\n<p>In Ashgabat, register at the office at 57 Azadi Street. If you’re not staying in Ashgabat, you should register at the local department office. You must provide 2 passport-size photos and provide confirmation of your departure date from your employer or sponsor.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxes-for-foreign-nationals\">Taxes for foreign nationals</h3>\n\n<p>On arrival, you must pay a migration fee of 14 US dollars. All foreign visitors must also pay a ‘tourism tax’ of 2 US dollars for each day of their stay in Turkmenistan. Hotels include the tax as a separate item on your bill.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customs-rules\">Customs rules</h2>\n\n<p>There are strict rules about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://customs.gov.tm/en/customs-info/for-individuals\">goods you can take into or out of Turkmenistan</a>. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.</p>\n\n<p>‘Tobacco products to the amount of 2 packs’ means you can bring one of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>2 packets of cigarettes – a total of 40 cigarettes</li>\n  <li>2 cigars</li>\n  <li>2 packs of tobacco each weighing no more than a packet of cigarettes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is illegal to give tobacco products as a gift. If you are caught, you could get a fine.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taking-money-into-turkmenistan\">Taking money into Turkmenistan</h3>\n\n<p>Turkmenistan is largely a cash-based society. Carry cash and pay in the Turkmen currency, manat. Some larger hotels and restaurants accept US dollars - you should check before purchasing. Other outlets are only allowed to accept manat.</p>\n\n<p>You can exchange US dollars and euros at the official manat rate easily at a bank or money exchange. Bring new, clean notes as exchanges will reject damaged or marked notes. An increasing number of establishments also refuse to accept $100 bills produced before 2009. You can check which version of dollar notes you have on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.uscurrency.gov/denominations/100\">US government website</a>. Other currencies are difficult to exchange. Manat cannot be re-converted, so exchange only as much as you need.</p>\n\n<p>There are a limited number of international ATMs in Ashgabat, but they can run out of manat notes. There’s a 3% withdrawal charge for each transaction. You are strongly recommended to bring enough dollars for your entire trip.</p>\n\n","slug":"entry-requirements","title":"Entry requirements"},{"body":"<h2 id=\"terrorism\">Terrorism</h2>\n\n<p>There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets.

Many social media apps and websites are blocked, including YouTube, X, Facebook and WhatsApp. Access to Yahoo, Gmail and Hotmail is often difficult. VPNs are illegal in Turkmenistan and are usually blocked as soon as the authorities identify them.</p>\n\n<p>There is a single state-owned mobile telephone provider, Altyn Asyr, which uses the TM CELL brand. Altyn Asyr does not provide a roaming service and the quality of the network is low.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"relationships-with-turkmens\">Relationships with Turkmens</h3>\n\n<p>The Turkmen authorities sometimes prosecute Turkmen women if they start a sexual relationship with a foreign man, who may be fined and deported.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Male same-sex sexual activity is illegal, and punishable by a prison sentence.

You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"International Driving Permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<p>Driving standards are poor. Road travel at night outside cities is particularly dangerous because of the condition of the roads. There is a 60km/h speed limit in much of Ashgabat, enforced by both static speed cameras and police with mobile speed cameras. There are no signs warning of speed cameras.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>Licensed taxis are clearly identified and are white or yellow.
