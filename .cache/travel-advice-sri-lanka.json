Stay aware of your surroundings at all times, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>The conflict in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories has led to heightened tensions around the world. Terrorist groups such as Al-Qaida and Daesh, have called on their supporters to carry out terrorist attacks in response to the conflict. The conflict could also motivate individuals to carry out attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Terrorist attacks could target Jewish or Muslim communities, or the interests of Israel and its allies. Attacks could also be indiscriminate and occur without warning.</p>\n\n<p>On Easter Sunday in April 2019, more than 250 people, including 8 British nationals, were killed in terrorist attacks against 3 churches and 3 hotels in Sri Lanka: in Colombo, Negombo and in Batticaloa.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-and-economic-situation\">Political and economic situation</h2>\n\n<p>Protests and demonstrations can happen anywhere across the island at short notice, and can become violent. Security authorities may use water cannons and tear gas to control protesters.</p>\n\n<p>Large-scale protests in 2022 resulted in violence and loss of life. Movement around the island was difficult due to restrictions such as curfews and roadblocks. </p>\n\n<p>Avoid demonstrations, political protests or large gatherings. Monitor local media and sign up to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/sri-lanka/email-signup\">get email notifications when this advice is updated</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-yourself-and-your-belongings\">Protecting yourself and your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>There’s been an increase in incidents of low-level opportunistic crime. Store your belongings as safely as possible to avoid thefts from hotels and guesthouses. Minimise the number of personal items you carry with you. </p>\n\n<p>On the street, criminals may ride past on mopeds or motorbikes and try to snatch your bag. Take care of your passport and money by keeping them in a body-belt. Carry bags on the side of you that is furthest from the road and do not place bags in the front basket of bicycles.</p>\n\n<p>Violent crimes against foreigners are rare. Gun crime is not uncommon, but usually it is due to a dispute between different criminal groups.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bank-card-fraud\">Bank card fraud</h3>\n\n<p>Bank card fraud is common.</p>\n\n<p>Fraudsters can steal your card details without you noticing. Use ATMs inside banks or hotels if possible, and check ATMs on the street for signs of tampering. Keep cards in sight when paying in shops and restaurants. Read more about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/a-z-of-fraud/bank-card-and-cheque-fraud\">how to avoid bank card fraud</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-spiking\">Drink spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Be alert to the possible use of ‘date rape’ and other drugs including GHB.</p>\n\n<p>Do not take drinks from strangers or leave your drinks unattended. Victims of spiked drinks have been robbed and sometimes assaulted. Alcohol and drugs can reduce your vigilance, making you less in control. If you drink, know your limit. Drinks served in Sri Lanka are often stronger than in the UK as bars and hotels rarely use measures.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Women continue to report incidents of verbal and physical harassment by men, ranging from sexually suggestive or lewd comments to physical advances and sexual assaults.</p>\n\n<p>Incidents can happen anywhere, but the majority of reported cases take place in crowded areas including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>markets</li>\n  <li>bus and railway stations, or on buses</li>\n  <li>sporting events</li>\n  <li>tourist sites</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling alone or in small groups and consider carrying a personal alarm.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences </h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"personal-id\">Personal ID</h3>\n\n<p>You must always carry your passport as an official form of identification. A copy is usually acceptable, but in some situations you may have to produce the original at a police station within a specified time limit.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alcohol-laws-and-bans\">Alcohol laws and bans</h3>\n\n<p>Police could fine you if you ignore notices prohibiting alcohol in certain public areas.</p>\n\n<p>Alcohol is not usually available on religious holidays. Drinking in public on these days could be culturally insensitive. Check locally for dates of religious holidays when this applies.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"smoking-and-e-cigarette-bans\">Smoking and e-cigarette bans</h3>\n\n<p>Police could fine you if you ignore ‘no smoking’ signs in certain public areas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"detention-and-prison-sentences\">Detention and prison sentences</h3>\n\n<p>There are severe penalties for drug offences, terrorism and all other serious crimes. The authorities could hold you without charge indefinitely. If convicted, you may face a lengthy prison sentence.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re arrested under Sri Lanka’s Prevention of Terrorism Act, the authorities could detain you without charge awaiting a trial date. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-binoculars-and-drones-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras, binoculars and drones in secure areas</h3>\n\n<p>Do not fly drones near, use binoculars to look at, or take photographs of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>military bases</li>\n  <li>government buildings</li>\n  <li>vehicles used by VIPs</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Check how to register and operate drones with Sri Lanka’s <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.lk/en/faqs/on-drone-operations#i-am-a-foreigner-who-is-expecting-to-come-to-sri-lanka-to-spend-my-next-vacation-can-i-bring-my-drone-to-sri-lanka-for-my-own-usage\">Civil Aviation Authority</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers</h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex sexual activity is illegal, but we are not aware of any prosecutions.</p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-codes\">Dress codes</h3>\n\n<p>Nude or topless sunbathing is not allowed.</p>\n\n<p>If you enter a Buddhist temple:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>cover your legs and shoulders</li>\n  <li>take off shoes and hats</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"religion\">Religion</h3>\n\n<p>Disrespecting Buddhist images and artefacts, or making offensive remarks about religion, is a serious offence and can lead to arrest. If you have visible tattoos of Buddha, you can be refused entry to Sri Lanka or face deportation. Do not pose for photographs standing in front of a statue of Buddha.      </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wildlife\">Wildlife</h3>\n\n<p>Some Sri Lankan animals can be dangerous. If in doubt, follow advice from authorised guides or your travel operator. Wild elephants and crocodiles will attack humans on occasion. Venomous insects and snakes are found in many parts of the country – though not common in populated areas.</p>\n\n<p>Feral dogs are common and sometimes carry rabies.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism </h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-safety\">Swimming safety</h3>\n\n<p>Many beaches in Sri Lanka have dangerous surf or rip tides at certain times of the year. Get advice from your hotel or tour operator before going in the sea.</p>\n\n<p>See <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rlss.org.uk/safety-on-holiday\">water safety on holiday</a> from the Royal Life Saving Society.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks </h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel </h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Sri Lanka, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>. Tourists can hire cars, tuk tuks and motorbikes to drive. If you hire a vehicle, check that the company you rent the vehicle from is registered with the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://srilanka.travel/safe-and-secure\">Sri Lanka Tourist Board</a> and has a ‘Safe &amp; Secure’ certificate. You should also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>have appropriate insurance</li>\n  <li>ensure that the vehicle is roadworthy before you start your journey</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You need a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1949 international driving permit (IDP)</a> and a Sri Lankan ‘recognition permit’ to drive a hire vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot buy an IDP outside the UK, so get one before you travel. Take your UK driving licence and your IDP along with 2 passport photos to:</p>\n\n<div class=\"address\"><div class=\"adr org fn\"><p>\nAutomobile Association of Ceylon<br>40 Sir Mohomad Macan Markar Mawatha<br>Colombo 00300\n</p></div></div>\n\n<p>They will verify your documents and issue a recognition permit. Your hire car company will usually help with this.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-safety\">Road safety</h3>\n\n<p>Some roads, particularly in more remote areas, may be in poor condition. Driving is erratic and there are frequent road accidents, particularly at night. Stay alert for pedestrians and animals on busy roads. Riding a motorbike can be especially dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a collision, stay at the site of the accident with your vehicle as long as it is safe to do so. If it is not safe or if you feel threatened, report to a local police station.</p>\n\n<p>There are still security checkpoints on main roads in parts of the country. Follow the instructions of the police or army officers on duty. Security forces have opened fire on vehicles that have not stopped when asked. Roads around government and military sites in Colombo are often closed for security reasons, such as access for VIP convoys.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buses\">Buses</h3>\n\n<p>Public buses are often driven fast, rarely give way and are often poorly maintained leading to serious bus accidents in recent years. Tourist buses are usually driven more professionally and safely, but standards can vary.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis</h3>\n\n<p>You can book taxis using local and international taxi apps. There is less availability outside tourist areas. Motorised rickshaws (‘tuk-tuks’) are available for hire in towns and villages. Agree a price before you set off or look for one with a working meter.</p>\n\n<p>There are occasional reports of harassment, particularly of women travellers at night. Change to a different tuk-tuk or taxi if you have any concerns about the driver or their standard of driving.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>When travelling by train, make sure you stay within the train carriage while the train is moving. There have been fatal accidents when visitors have hung out of open doorways or windows of trains. Take care of your personal possessions at all times. There have been incidents of theft and pickpocketing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>You need prior permission to enter Sri Lankan waters and the security zones in coastal areas.</p>\n\n<p>The threat of piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean remains significant. The combined threat assessment of the international Naval Counter Piracy Forces is that all sailing yachts under their own passage should stay out of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://on-shore.mschoa.org/reference-documents/advice-for-sailing-vessels/\">designated High Risk Area</a> or face the risk of being hijacked and held hostage for ransom.</p>\n\n<p>See more advice on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">staying safe when travelling abroad by sea</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"monsoon\">Monsoon</h3>\n\n<p>Monsoon rains can cause flooding in many places in Sri Lanka.
