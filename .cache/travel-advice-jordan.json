If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.mfa.gov.jo/en/embassy/London\">Jordanian Embassy in the UK</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"passport-validity-requirements\">Passport validity requirements</h2>\n\n<p>To enter Jordan, your passport must have an ‘expiry date’ at least 6 months after the date you arrive.</p>\n\n<p>Check with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/renew-adult-passport/renew\">Renew your passport</a> if you need to.</p>\n\n<p>You will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been reported lost or stolen.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dual-nationals\">Dual nationals</h3>\n\n<p>If you are a British-Jordanian dual national, you can use your British passport to enter Jordan, but you must show your Jordanian passport when you leave.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"children-with-a-jordanian-passport\">Children with a Jordanian passport  </h3>\n\n<p>Children with a Jordanian passport, who are travelling without their father, cannot depart Jordan without a letter of permission signed by their father.

It costs 40 Jordanian dinars and is valid for one month. Some airlines may ask you to submit a health declaration at check-in.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re visiting for tourism, you can <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.jordanpass.jo/\">apply for a Jordan Pass online</a> before you arrive. You will not need to pay tourist entry visa fees if you stay at least 3 nights (4 days).

You cannot enter Jordan using the King Hussein Bridge/Allenby crossing without getting a visa beforehand.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to combine travel to Jordan with a visit to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, you can get a multiple-entry visa before you travel from the Jordanian Embassy in London. You should also check the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/israel\">Israel travel advice</a> before using the land borders to enter Israel.</p>\n\n<p>On the Jordanian side, board guards will stamp passports unless the traveller requests otherwise and tells them before they hand over their passport.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"departure-tax\">Departure tax</h2>\n\n<p>You must pay a departure tax of 10 Jordanian dinars in cash at all land border crossings.
