Daesh has previously targeted border crossings and nearby locations on the Syrian side of the border.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation</h2>\n\n<p>Demonstrations occur occasionally in cities and may become violent. Police have used tear gas and water cannon to disperse protests.</p>\n\n<p>Events in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories have led to heightened tensions in the region and  in locations across Turkey. Large demonstrations continue to occur outside diplomatic missions connected to the conflict in major cities, particularly Israeli diplomatic missions in Ankara and Istanbul.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid all demonstrations and leave the area if one develops. Local transport routes may be disrupted.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-yourself-and-your-belongings\">Protecting yourself and your belongings</h3>\n\n<p>Street robbery and pickpocketing are common in the major tourist areas of Istanbul. Be aware of your personal belongings and make sure they are always secure.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"counterfeit-banknotes\">Counterfeit banknotes </h3>\n\n<p>Banks and money exchanges may not accept $50 or $100 US dollar bills, due to a reported surge in counterfeit banknotes of these denominations in Turkey. You should not accept these banknotes where possible.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drink-and-food-spiking\">Drink and food spiking</h3>\n\n<p>Be wary of strangers approaching you to change money, or to take you to a restaurant or nightclub. If strangers offer you food and drink these could be spiked. Buy your own drinks and always keep sight of them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"counterfeit-alcohol\">Counterfeit Alcohol </h3>\n\n<p>In Turkey, including Ankara and Istanbul, people have died or suffered serious illness after drinking illegally produced local spirits and counterfeit bottles of branded alcohol.</p>\n\n<p>To protect yourself: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>buy alcoholic beverages only from licensed liquor stores </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>buy drinks only at licensed bars and hotels </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>avoid home-made alcoholic drinks </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>check bottle seals are intact </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>check labels for poor print quality or incorrect spelling </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you have any concerns, ask for advice from your tour operator or the Turkish authorities.  </p>\n\n<p>Seek <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/turkey-list-of-medical-practitioners/list-of-medical-facilities-in-turkey\">urgent medical attention</a> if you or someone you are travelling with falls ill after drinking alcohol.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>In 2023, 42 cases of sexual assault, including rape, were reported to British consular staff in Turkey.

There have also been sexual attacks on minors visiting toilet facilities alone. Be extra vigilant in these situations.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxi-safety\">Taxi safety</h3>\n\n<p>Accepting lifts from drivers of unofficial taxis is highly risky.

Make sure your travel insurance covers you for all activities you do.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"quad-biking-and-mopeds\">Quad biking and mopeds</h3>\n\n<p>Quad biking is an extreme sport and carries the risk of serious injury or death. You need specific travel insurance to cover quad biking. Always read the details of your insurance cover, especially the small print and exclusions on your policy.</p>\n\n<p>Make sure you are given full instructions and training before your activity.</p>\n\n<p>Insurance sold by the hire company usually only provides third party insurance. It’s likely you will be charged for any damage to the rental vehicle and you may face arrest if you do not pay.</p>\n\n<p>If you hire a moped you need a valid driving licence with at least category A1 - ‘light motorcycle’.

You must also <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-insurance/driving-abroad\">carry a green card</a> to show you have third party insurance.</p>\n\n<p>If you bring a vehicle registered in another country into Turkey, observe the Turkish customs regulations. Check if you need a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/flags-identifiers-and-stickers\">UK sticker to drive your car outside the UK</a>. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-conditions\">Driving conditions</h3>\n\n<p>Take care when travelling by road, particularly at night. Approach checkpoints slowly and follow the instructions of security personnel. Roads between major cities are generally in excellent condition, but the road surface can be poor in remote areas. Accidents are common – mainly due to poor or reckless driving.</p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to ride without a helmet on motorcycles and mopeds. You may get a severe fine if you are not wearing a helmet.</p>\n\n<p>Do not drink and drive.

Follow the directions of local authorities.</p>\n\n<p>If you see a wildfire, call emergency services on 112.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"flooding\">Flooding</h3>\n\n<p>Severe rainstorms can cause flooding and landslides across Turkey, damaging roads and bridges. Some routes may become impassable, making it difficult to travel and reducing essential services.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re in an affected area:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>monitor local media</li>\n  <li>follow instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes</h3>\n\n<p>Many parts of Turkey regularly experience earthquakes and tremors. These can be a high magnitude, cause damage to infrastructure, and pose a risk to life.</p>\n\n<p>A 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Gaziantep and neighbouring provinces in the south-east of Turkey in February 2023. Strong earthquakes may continue to affect the region and it remains heavily damaged. There is a shortage of local accommodation.</p>\n\n<p>Follow any advice given by the local authorities.  See the US Federal Emergency Management Agency guidance about what to do <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">before, during and after an earthquake</a> .</p>\n\n","slug":"safety-and-security","title":"Safety and security"},{"body":"<p>This section has safety advice for regions of Turkey.
