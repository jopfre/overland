Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"political-situation\">Political situation </h2>\n\n<p>Although a ceasefire exists, the eastern border between Armenia and Azerbaijan is closed and tensions remain. See <a href=\"/foreign-travel-advice/armenia/regional-risks\">regional risks</a> for details about <abbr title=\"Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office \">FCDO</abbr>’s warning against all travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"protests\">Protests </h3>\n\n<p>Protests sometimes take place in central Yerevan and other major cities. These are usually organised by opposition political parties or activist groups highlighting topical social and political issues. Although protests tend to be peaceful and usually pass off without incident, avoid large crowds and demonstrations, follow the advice and instructions of the local authorities, monitor the media and remain vigilant.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime </h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"protecting-your-belongings\">Protecting your belongings </h3>\n\n<p>Crime levels are low. There are occasional incidents of pickpocketing, bag-snatching, theft from cars and burglary involving foreign nationals. To help protect your belongings: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>leave spare cash, passports and valuables in a safe place</li>\n  <li>carry a copy of the photo page of your passport rather than the original document</li>\n  <li>when using ATMs check no one is watching or following you</li>\n  <li>take particular care if using an ATM after dark</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences  </h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-and-prison-sentences\">Illegal drugs and prison sentences </h3>\n\n<p>If you use illegal drugs, you can get fines and a long prison sentence. The penalty for smuggling drugs is a prison sentence of between 4 and 10 years. </p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to use, possess or trade marijuana, cannabidiol (CBD), or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products. You can be prosecuted for having these substances even when they are prescribed for medical purposes. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars-in-secure-areas\">Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas </h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to photograph sites such as military bases, equipment and installations. These are considered sensitive areas and visitors have been detained and questioned for attempting to photograph them. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lgbt-travellers\">LGBT+ travellers </h3>\n\n<p>Same-sex sexual activity has been legal since 2003 but many Armenians still view same-sex couples with disapproval. LGBT+ people in Armenia tend to be discreet about their sexuality. Local LGBT+ groups occasionally suffer from verbal and physical harassment. Physical contact between members of the same sex, such as holding hands and kissing, are common signs of friendship in Armenian culture, and not necessarily an indicator of sexual orientation. </p>\n\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-foreign-travel-advice\">advice for LGBT+ travellers</a>. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"disorderly-behaviour\">Disorderly behaviour </h3>\n\n<p>Armenian society does not tolerate drinking to excess as this leads to disorderly behaviour, particularly during the late evening and through the night. British nationals have been arrested for drunken behaviour.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks  </h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis\">Taxis </h3>\n\n<p>If you hail taxis on the street you risk being scammed for high fares. There have also been occasional reports of taxi drivers sexually harassing single female passengers. You can download the GG taxi app on your phone when you arrive. GG is considered a reputable taxi app service in Armenia.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-transport\">Public transport </h3>\n\n<p>Public transport is often overcrowded, particularly in Yerevan. Yerevan buses are modern, but local buses in the regions may be old and poorly maintained.   </p>\n\n<p>If you travel on the cross-border train service between Armenia and Georgia, secure your valuables, do not leave the compartment unattended, and lock the door from the inside.  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel  </h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Armenia, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a> and check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/country/armenia\">rules of the road in the RAC’s Armenia guide</a>.

You cannot buy an <abbr title=\"international driving permit\">IDP</abbr> outside the UK, so get one before you travel.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-safety\">Road safety </h3>\n\n<p>The standard of driving is poor. Be prepared for drivers who drive recklessly and ignore traffic laws. Roads are in a poor state, particularly in the coldest months, from November to February. If possible avoid driving outside of cities and towns in the dark because of the poor condition of the roads and lack of lighting.  </p>\n\n<p>If you are walking, be careful when crossing roads and use subways where available. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel </h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-air-safety-list\">UK Air Safety List</a> (<abbr title=\"UK Air Safety List\">ASL</abbr>) lists all known airlines in Armenia that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to, from, and within the UK. Check <abbr title=\"UK Air Safety List\">ASL</abbr> when considering which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/Commercial-Industry/Airlines/Licensing/Requirements-and-guidance/Third-Country-Operator-Certificates\">UK Civil Aviation Authority</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The UK has placed sanctions on Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines and Ural Airlines, which operate out of Russia and fly to Armenia. It is illegal under UK law for any British national or British company to buy tickets from these airlines.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters </h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"earthquakes\">Earthquakes </h3>\n\n<p>There is a risk of earthquakes. The last serious earthquake was in 1988 in the Lori region in the north. It killed between 25,000 and 50,000 people, injured thousands and left several cities in ruins. </p>\n\n<p>The US Federal Emergency Management Agency has advice about <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ready.gov/earthquakes\">what to do before, during and after an earthquake</a>.</p>\n\n","slug":"safety-and-security","title":"Safety and security"},{"body":"<p>This section has safety advice for regions of Armenia.
