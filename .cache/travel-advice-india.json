Comply with the police if they are at the scene. If the police are not present, it could be unsafe to remain at the scene. If safe to do so, go to the nearest police station.</p>\n\n<p>Driving can be dangerous in urban and rural areas due to wandering livestock. Accidents involving cows can draw crowds and potentially lead to violence. Anyone in the vehicle involved may be attacked or targeted for extortion. It is common to use your horn or flash your headlights frequently to announce your presence on the road.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling at night and in fog as accidents are common due to low visibility and there is a higher risk of crime at night. Always travel in a well-maintained vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>If you travel by motorbike, wear a helmet and proper footwear.</p>\n\n<p>Buses are often driven fast and recklessly. Accidents are common.</p>\n\n<p>Be careful when crossing streets, even in marked pedestrian areas and especially at night, as vehicles sometimes drive on the wrong side of the road.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"taxis-and-rickshaws\">Taxis and rickshaws</h3>\n\n<p>Avoid travelling alone and hailing taxis on the street, especially at night. App-based taxis like Uber and Ola are widely available, including in all airport terminal buildings. Pre-paid taxi services are also available and many hotels offer transfers. If a hotel driver is collecting you at the airport by, make sure they properly identify themselves before you set off.</p>\n\n<p>If you book a taxi online, there’s usually a way to share journey details with your contacts who can then follow your location.</p>\n\n<p>Seatbelts are not common in 3-wheel taxis (autos) or in the back seats of taxis. Try to use taxis that have seatbelts.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"air-travel\">Air travel</h3>\n\n<p>When travelling through an airport, allow enough time to complete check-in and security procedures, as your baggage may need to go through screening equipment and checks. Allow time for transiting between flights if you need to change from international terminals to domestic terminals, even if using the airport shuttle service.</p>\n\n<p>If you arrive on a charter flight booked through a tour operator, you can only fly into and out of the country with the same charter operator. Chartered flight passengers are not allowed to fly into or out of the country using a scheduled airline. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rail-travel\">Rail travel</h3>\n\n<p>Train travel in India is generally safe, however accidents happen and have previously resulted in death and serious injury. There are police or guards on trains and stations if you need help.</p>\n\n<p>When travelling by train:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>do not accept food or drinks from strangers</li>\n  <li>take care of your passport and valuables as thefts are common</li>\n  <li>avoid people at railway stations offering tickets and tours as you may be scammed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>Tourist boats and other small craft rarely carry life-saving equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Although piracy has not so far affected India’s territorial waters, it poses a significant threat in parts of the Indian Ocean. Mariners should follow shipping industry guidelines on precautions to take.</p>\n\n<p>Ships and crew must have the necessary authorisation and paperwork before entering Indian territorial waters and follow Indian laws and regulations. If carrying weapons on board ships in Indian territorial waters, you must follow Indian laws and regulations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extreme-weather-and-natural-disasters\">Extreme weather and natural disasters</h2>\n\n<p>India can experience extreme weather events that threaten life and disrupt infrastructure, including buildings, roads and communications.</p>\n\n<p>Find out what you can do to prepare for and respond to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tropical-cyclones\">extreme weather and natural hazards</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You should:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>plan your travel so that you are aware of seasonal weather events, such as monsoon rains</li>\n  <li>follow the advice of local authorities and your travel company</li>\n  <li>check the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://mausam.imd.gov.in/\">Indian Meteorological Department</a> for weather updates</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"monsoons\">Monsoons</h3>\n\n<p>The monsoon season in India usually runs from June to October.
