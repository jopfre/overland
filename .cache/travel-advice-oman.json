In October 2023, there was a small, peaceful demonstration outside the British Embassy. Further unannounced demonstrations are possible throughout the country. Stay alert and avoid large crowds.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware of local sensitivities on these issues and follow the advice of the Omani authorities. Follow news reports and be alert to local and regional developments, which might trigger public disturbances.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"crime\">Crime</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"sexual-assault\">Sexual assault</h3>\n\n<p>Personal attacks against foreign nationals, including sexual assault and rape, are relatively rare, but happen. Take care when walking or travelling alone, particularly at night. You should maintain at least the same level of personal security awareness as you would in the UK. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/advice-for-women-travelling-abroad\">advice for women travelling abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"laws-and-cultural-differences\">Laws and cultural differences</h2>\n\n<p>Oman’s laws and customs are very different to those in the UK and reflect the fact that Oman is an Islamic country.

If you live in Oman, carry your Omani ID.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ramadan\">Ramadan    </h3>\n\n<p>Ramadan is a holy month for Muslims. The dates vary by year and country.

The legal drinking age is 21.</p>\n\n<p>Non-Muslim residents can get a licence to drink alcohol at home from the Royal Oman Police. Liquor licences are not available to non-residents.    </p>\n\n<p>It is illegal to drink alcohol in public, be drunk in public or to drink-drive. The police have arrested and charged British nationals for these offences. Border police may arrest passengers travelling through Omani airports or seaports under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"e-cigarette-and-vape-bans\">E-cigarette and vape bans</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to import or use e-cigarettes or vape products in Oman.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"blood-test-following-arrest\">Blood test following arrest</h3>\n\n<p>If you are arrested, the authorities may require you to take a blood test, particularly if they suspect you have used drugs or alcohol. If you refuse, you could be arrested for your failure to comply.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dress-codes\">Dress codes</h3>\n\n<p>You should dress modestly in public areas including in shopping malls. Your clothing should cover the tops of your arms and legs (below the knee), and underwear should not be visible.</p>\n\n<p>Wearing tight-fitting clothes is likely to attract attention. Do not wear swimming costumes or beachwear in public areas, except on tourist beaches or at swimming pools.</p>\n\n<p>Cross-dressing is illegal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"unmarried-couples\">Unmarried couples </h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to live with or share a hotel room with someone of the opposite sex if you are not married or closely related.</p>\n\n<p>You may have difficulty registering the birth of a baby born in Oman if you are unmarried or in a relationship the Omani authorities do not recognise as marriage.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"illegal-drugs-penalties\">Illegal drugs penalties</h3>\n\n<p>There are severe penalties for importing, trafficking, smuggling and possessing drugs, even residual amounts. In some cases, offenders could get the death penalty. There is no distinction in Omani law between ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ drugs – both are treated with equal severity.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"public-offences\">Public offences</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to swear and make rude gestures, including while driving. You can also be charged with obscenity for social media posts or shared photos or videos.</p>\n\n<p>Showing affection in public is frowned upon and may bring you to the attention of the police.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"pornography\">Pornography</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to create, import or share pornographic images and videos, even if created for personal use with the consent of those involved.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"using-cameras-and-binoculars\">Using cameras and binoculars</h3>\n\n<p>It is illegal to photograph some government buildings and military sites.

You can pay fines at the airport. If you have not paid, or are involved in legal proceedings, the authorities may delay or prevent your departure.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"child-custody-cases\">Child custody cases</h3>\n\n<p>The border authorities may prevent children from leaving Oman if they are the subject of a child custody dispute.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"outdoor-activities-and-adventure-tourism\">Outdoor activities and adventure tourism     </h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"swimming-safety\">Swimming safety</h3>\n\n<p>See <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.rlss.org.uk/safety-on-holiday\">water safety on holiday</a> from the Royal Life Saving Society.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"hiking-and-mountaineering\">Hiking and mountaineering</h3>\n\n<p>When hiking in Oman, be sure to follow marked hiking trails.  </p>\n\n<p>Extreme heat has caused deaths in Oman due to dehydration and heat exhaustion – see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/news/632/heatwaves\">advice for travellers affected by extreme heat</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"transport-risks\">Transport risks</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"road-travel\">Road travel</h3>\n\n<p>If you are planning to drive in Oman, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad\">information on driving abroad</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive a rental car in Oman for the first 6 weeks after you arrive. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/exchange-paper-driving-licence\">update it to a photocard licence</a> or get the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/international-driving-permit\">1949 version of the international driving permit (IDP)</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p>If you live in Oman or are staying longer than 6 weeks, you must get an Omani licence.</p>\n\n<p>Hire car companies often have stricter requirements for their customers, such as a year of driving experience, a higher minimum age and holding an IDP.</p>\n\n<p>Drink-driving is a serious offence in Oman. If you are tested and found to have any alcohol in your system, you may get a fine and possible imprisonment.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"reporting-traffic-accidents\">Reporting traffic accidents</h3>\n\n<p>If you are involved in a serious traffic accident and do not need emergency treatment, you must stay with your vehicle and call the Royal Oman Police on 9999.</p>\n\n<p>Serious accidents include those with:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>severe damage to vehicles</li>\n  <li>injuries or deaths</li>\n  <li>damage to public or private property</li>\n  <li>drink-driving or drugs</li>\n  <li>one or more drivers without a licence (or with a suspended licence)</li>\n  <li>uninsured vehicles</li>\n  <li>military or security vehicles</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may not need to call the police after a minor accident, but you must complete a minor road traffic accident form. You must keep a form in your car – you can get one from your insurance company and at a police station. Car rental companies are responsible for keeping forms in their cars.</p>\n\n<p>In a minor accident there is generally:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>limited damage to vehicles</li>\n  <li>no injury or death</li>\n  <li>no damage to public or private property, apart from vehicles and property belonging to those involved</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"rules-of-the-road\">Rules of the road   </h3>\n\n<p>Rules of the road in Oman include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>all passengers must wear seatbelts</li>\n  <li>all children aged 3 and under must use child car seats</li>\n  <li>it is illegal to use a mobile phone while driving</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Omani authorities strictly enforce traffic laws. There are severe penalties for traffic offences, including fines of up to 3,000 Omani rials or prison sentences of up to 3 years.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-conditions\">Driving conditions</h3>\n\n<p>Driving can be dangerous outside Muscat. There is a risk of hitting wandering camels and goats on the road. Rainfall can cause sudden, severe floods in dry riverbeds and on roads that cross them.</p>\n\n<p>The condition of Omani roads is generally good. Driving standards in Oman are not always as disciplined as those in the UK, and the rate of traffic accidents in Oman is significantly higher.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"desert-and-mountain-travel\">Desert and mountain travel</h3>\n\n<p>Road trips to the desert and mountains can be dangerous unless you’re in a well-equipped 4-wheel-drive vehicle. You should always:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>travel in convoy if possible</li>\n  <li>take a supply of water</li>\n  <li>take a mobile phone or satellite phone</li>\n  <li>leave a copy of your travel plans with friends or relatives</li>\n  <li>make sure you’re insured for this type of travel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"sea-travel\">Sea travel</h3>\n\n<p>The safety of tourist boats may not be up to UK standards. Make sure life jackets are available for all passengers.</p>\n\n<p>Many areas of the Gulf of Aden are restricted. Vessels entering these areas have been detained and inspected, sometimes resulting in arrests. You should make careful enquiries before entering these waters or visiting ports. Consider how regional tensions may affect your route.</p>\n\n<p>Vessels may be at increased risk of maritime attack, including piracy, in:   </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the Gulf of Oman</li>\n  <li>the Northern Arabian Sea</li>\n  <li>the Gulf of Aden</li>\n  <li>Bab El Mandeb</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sea-river-and-piracy-safety\">piracy in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean</a>.
